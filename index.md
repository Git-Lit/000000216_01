  A VERY SMALL TOWN.

In the whole west of France there is no
prettier town than D Lying rather
out of the way, it has as yet had but few
pretexts for " improving" itself, and in
many respects presents the same appearance
as it did some half a century ago. D 

is nothing in particular; not a fishing town,
for the sea is too far off; nor a
manufacturing town, for " business " of that kind isabVOL. I. B

  ALL FOR GREED.

sorbed by Cholet, which is some ten leagues
distant, and represents the manufacturing
interest. D is, if anything, an
occasional place of passage or rest for drovers,
who still find it quickest and cheapest to
drive their Choletais oxen from the banks of
the Levres to the more central towns on the
banks of the Loire, pending the
establishment of small local railway branches. No
railroad leads to D If it did, old
Martin Prevost would not have been the
great ruler of that small town that he truly
Avas.


Martin Prevost was of Swiss extraction.
His grandfather had been valet de chambre,
steward, factotum, alter ego, to a famous
Vendean chief,—a proud rich noble of the
ancient regime, but one of the few who
preferred the hard active life of a partisan to
<!-- Leaf 21, Page: 3 -->
anything Court favour could offer him, and
who was genuinely glad to exchange
Versailles for the hazards and hardships of La
Chouannerie. The trading principle being
uppermost in the mind of the Helvetian,
the confidant of Monsieur le Marquis soon
became rich. It was said that he managed
to sell a good many of the necessaries of
existence to both sides at once, and that both
were his grateful customers. He was never
known to betray either, but merely got
out of each all he could. Monsieur le
Marquis died in exile, earning starvation
wages by the French lessons he gave in an
English seaport town, and his valet de
chambre died possessed of a house in
D, in which he had, at the time of the
Consulate, opened what Americans would
call a "store." His principle was one of
<!-- Leaf 22, Page: 4 -->
beautiful simplicity. He bought everything
and sold everything; striving only with
delightful single-mindedness never to realise
any profit under twenty per cent, upon
either operation. He married a wife who
was crooked and blind of one eye, but these
slight defects were fully compensated for to
him by the dower she brought him, and
which he laid out so as to double it,—of
which fact she never had the smallest token
or proof.


His son was unworthy of his sire, and did
nothing to improve his position in life. The
father judged his offspring severely, but took
care to get him advantageously married, and
when he died, recommended him to the care
of his wife.


Prevost II. went through life and out of
it, unnoticed; but did not dissipate his estate,
<!-- Leaf 23, Page: 5 -->
so that, at his death, in 1835, he left what
his father had left him, and what his wife's
dot had added to that, untouched and entire
to his two sons.


In Martin Prevost, the younger of these
two sons, the spirit of the grandfather
burned strongly, and was intensified by that
atmosphere of barter which in France above
all countries, is the very " over-soul" of
mankind in this nineteenth century. Martin
Prevost carried the destinies of his house to
a remarkable height, and at the time of
which we are writing he was virtually the
ruler of D and its population of 3,800
souls.


Martin Prevost was the money-lender of
the whole district, ancl as those who
borrowed rarely paid in cash, and as he never
lent save on unexceptional security, it is not
<!-- Leaf 24, Page: 6 -->
difficult to calculate how from decade to
decade Martin's power and wealth increased.
Soon after his father's death he bought a
Charge de Notaire, which he kept for six or
seven years, and then sold to considerable.
advantage; for he had gained for this office
such repute that people of high standing
came to consult him, from distant towns
even, and his opinion and advice were worth
gold ! When Monsieur Martin Prevost sold
his Etude he called this proceeding retiring
from business. ''Je me retire des affaires,"
said he; but there were one or two
sharpeyed individuals, and D numbered
marvellously few such, who opined that on the
contrary this was the very period when
Prevost's business seriously began. By the
time he had been six or seven years a notary,
no family within twenty or thirty miles had
<!-- Leaf 25, Page: 7 -->
a secret of which he was unpossessed; and
when he delivered over the various and
voluminous documents of his office to his
unsuspecting successor, he carried away in his
prodigious memory the details of the
financial complications of the entire
neighbourhood. But old Prevost was a wise man, and
though his power was felt and
acknowledged, he never allowed it to be supposed
that he ever could possibly presume upon
it. He lived well, but modestly and
economically, having but one servant, a woman
for whom he had the deepest respect, and
as outdoor servant, a man who was
gardener, labourer, groom, and commissionnaire
to Madame Jean.  
  
  
  It used to be said in and about D

that no one knew anything that was not
good, and that no one felt anything that
<!-- Leaf 26, Page: 8 -->
was, touching Martin Prevost; yet every one
applied to him, and every one, at some
moment or other of their lives, trusted
him. He had never married, but he had
adopted his nephew, and given the young
fellow an excellent education. Old Martin's
brother had turned out ill,—that is,
unlucky,—and had died young in America,
whither he had emigrated, terribly in debt.
What became of his wife, or who or what
she was, no one in D ever heard.
Some people said she had run away from
him; but Martin had the boy sent to him,
when he was only six years old, had brought
him up since then, and, I repeat it, had
brought him up well. What created no
little astonishment was, that he had not
brought him up over strictly, but in the
way of liberty and money gave him to the
<!-- Leaf 27, Page: 9 -->
full as much as other young men of his
station could boast of possessing.


Wednesday was market day in D,
and on a certain Wednesday, not quite two
years ago, a little group of two or three
women was gathered round the open door of
Martin Prevost's house talking with
Madame Jean. There was the same character
of sharpness in each of those female faces,
but Madame Jean had an air of authority
which the others lacked, and the basket she
carried on her strong stout arm was half as
big and half as full again as any of the
other women's baskets. It was not much
past eight o'clock, and though the October
sun was warm, the air was still cool, and a
fresh but not unpleasant wind shook the
boughs of the lime-trees overhanging the
terrace of old Prevost's garden.
<!-- Leaf 28, Page: 10 -->

\"Certainly poultry is out of all price,"
cried bitterly a skinny, black-browed woman,
looking enviously at Madame Jean, and at a
pair of huge Cochin-Chinese legs that
protruded from her basket. " We up at the
Mairie haven't gone out of beef and
vegetables for I don't know how long;—and
beef, up now at thirteen sous, one franc six
a kilo, as they will call it;—well! I reckon
by pounds and sous, I can't take to their
new ways, though I do belong to the
Administration." At this the speaker drew
herself up with pride.


\"Yes," said Madame Jean, " beef is dear,
and veal is bad,—all strings;—and poultry
is dear, and everything is dear."


\"But nothing is too dear for la maison
Prevost," interrupted the purveyor of
Monsieur le Maire. "Mere Jubine well knows
<!-- Leaf 29, Page: 11 -->
where she can place a fowl even for the sum
of three francs ten,—four francs even, who
can tell ? "


\"Mere Jubine owed it me ! " replied, with
dictatorial tone, Madame Jean. " The last
I bought from her was an unsatisfactory
fowl, so I reckoned it her at only half price,
and took this one to make up. Our young
man is not well just now, and wants light
food, so I shall let him eat poultry for a few
days. Bless my soul! it ain't such an extra
after all. With two pots au feu there's the
whole week; reckon :—all depends on the
management, no extras are any matter if
you are a menagere, and if you are not, why
you come to think bread itself an extra;
but where are the menageres?" Madame
Jean said this defiantly, and the other
matrons were cowed.
<!-- Leaf 30, Page: 12 -->

\"Is anything serious the matter with
Monsieur Richard?" asked the mildest
looking of the group in a propitiatory
manner.


\"Serious ? No ! " responded Madame
Jean, as though it would have been absurd
to suppose that anything serious could be
the matter in so prosperous a house as that
of Monsieur Prevost. " Serious ? No !
but you know he never was the strongest of
the strong; he's not a Turk nor a
weightthrower at the fair, and he's never quite got
over his attack of the lungs this winter;
he's delicate, if you will, but care makes up
for everything, and he gets lots of it."


"Why didn't you buy that hare of Mere
Lucas?" whined out the chief of the
mayor's kitchen. "I've heard say game
was good for invalids."
<!-- Leaf 31, Page: 13 -->

\"Because I didn't choose," retorted
Madame Jean sharply.


\"Oh ! " was the rejoinder. " Faites
excuse. I thought it might be because of
something else," and the woman looked
warlike. But war with Madame Jean
was not a thing to be dreamt of, as she
quickly showed. Turning sharply round,
and resting the whole of her outspread
hand upon one end of her big basket,
which drove the other end of that
wellfilled recipient so far up behind her shoulder
that the Cochin-Chinese legs seemed almost
sprouting from her back like cherubs'
wings—"Madelon," said she, "you mean
Prosper Morel. I know quite well what
you mean; but we know all about it as
well as you do, and we don't want Monsieur
le Maire or anybody else to inform us of
<!-- Leaf 32, Page: 14 -->
anything. I had my thoughts about that
hare, if you must know; that hare never
was shot,—that hare was caught, caught
mayhap on Monsieur Riviere's land,
therefore stolen. There; call it by its name,
stolen; a deal more likely stolen by Prosper
Morel than by any one else; but what
then? primo, where's the proof? You
believe it; the Maire believes it; the
garde's certain sure of it; but more, than
all, I believe it; but what then ? Prosper
has had his permit taken from him;
Monsieur wouldn't help him to get it; and what
then ? Suppose the garde catches him, and
draws up his proces-verbal, and he gets
condemned and fined, and justice is satisfied,
and suppose Monsieur turns him out of his
hut up there in the forest, and gets another
woodcutter. Well, suppose all that, what
<!-- Leaf 33, Page: 15 -->
then? Who'll be shot in a by-path, or
have his throat cut in his back shop, or have
his house burnt over his head?" The
women all looked aghast and nodded their
heads ominously, as though admitting that it
was but too true.


"You fancy, do you," continued Madame
Jean, "that that silent, sulky, hulking
Breton would let the worst come to the worst
without having his revenge. But all the
same, Madelon : don't you imagine we don't
know as well as Monsieur le Maire what
goes on in D; only I don't buy trapped
game. Monsieur Richard's chasse suffices
us. We are regular people, and eat the
hares and partridges off our own stubble.
If Mere Lucas makes one franc fifty clear
profit out of a hare, she pays fifty centimes,
taking the risk. She's welcome to it, but I
<!-- Leaf 34, Page: 16 -->
don't put the one franc fifty into her pocket,
not I! "


\"Monsieur le Cure's Lise does," observed
the mdd-mannered woman.


\"Oh ! Monsieur le Cure's Lise ! " snarled
Madelon in her most contemptuous tone,
and as though no proceeding could possibly
be too objectionable for Monsieur le Cure's
Lise.


\"Well! Monsieur le Cure's Lise ? "
retorted Madame Jean. " She's a wise woman;
she gets for two francs a hare worth four,
not to say five, if we were in carnival time,
and no harm done. Monsieur le Cure may
do what he likes."


\"There she goes across the street,"
remarked Madelon.


\"And Celeste from down at Verancour's,
with her," added her soft spoken companion.
<!-- Leaf 35, Page: 17 -->

A laugh, indulged in together, by
Madame Jean and Madelon, seemed to
establish peace between them.


\"It would be a fine sight to see what she
has bought at market," sneered Madelon;
\"two potatoes, three olives, and an onion,
maybe ! They do say that on fast days
Celeste serves up fish a week old! "


"Fish!" echoed Madame Jean; "fish
out of sea or river comes a deal too dear for
the Chateau!" She laid a tremendously
pompous accent on the first syllable. " I
was once inside their doors, and in going
away I had just to cross the dining-room as
they were coining in to dinner. If you'll
believe me, there was, besides a soup of
bread and water, nothing but lentils and a
red herring. But, Lord! weren't they set
out in fine silver dishes! It was the  
  
  
  vol. i. c
<!-- Leaf 36, Page: 18 -->
Wednesday of the quatre-temps de
Septembre. I've wondered to myself ever
since then what it is they live upon; for
the wind that blows, however healthy it
may be, won't keep body and soul together
in three grown-up people."


\"Live upon?" exclaimed almost savagely
Madelon. "Why, upon their own
importance ! "


"To be sure," remarked the concdiatory
one of the group, " they do believe in
themselves !"


\"Yes," muttered Madame Jean, " to
make up for nobody else's -believing in
them."


"Never mind," added Madelon, "let's
see what Celeste has got in the way of
flesh for these grandees, for it's not the
quatre-temps de Septembre now, and they
<!-- Leaf 37, Page: 19 -->
must put something more than vanity into
their stomachs, all the same. Ce "


"Hush!" said Madame Jean, stopping
the loud appeal which the other woman was
preparing to address to the two bonnes who
were at the further side of the street.
"Hush! There's Monsieur le Vicomte
himself turning the corner down to the
left, and coming this way."


\"Ugh ! " grunted Madelon. " What's
he wanting up hereabouts ? I thought his
daily mass was hardly over by this tune."


\"He's coming here," said Madame Jean;
and a moment later the person alluded to
came up from behind, divided the group of
women, touching his hat as he passed, and
saying " Pardon, mesdames ! " confronted
Madame Jean on the doorsteps on which she
was standing. The women nodded to each
<!-- Leaf 38, Page: 20 -->
other and parted, leaving Madame Jean alone
on the threshold of the maison Prevost.


"Could I see Monsieur Prevost for a
moment ? " inquired the new comer, politely.


\"Quite impossible at this hour," rejoined
Madame Jean after a most stately fashion.
\"Monsieur has not yet breakfasted. It
is not yet nine. Monsieur breakfasts as the
clock strikes ten, and Monsieur never sees
any one before breakfast. You have not
come by appointment ? " she asked.  
  
  
  "No—not exactly—but "


\"Of course not," interrupted Madame
Jean. "Monsieur would have informed
me."


\"But my business is very pressing,"
urged the petitioner, " and would not take
up more than a quarter of an hour."  
  
  
  But it was no use. Madame Jean was
<!-- Leaf 39, Page: 21 -->
\"in the exercise of her functions," and
any one who has ever had dealings with
them, knows in that particular state how
unmanageable is a Frenchman or a
Frenchwoman. Madame Jean was not impolite;
she was impervious, opaque, not to be
penetrated by an influence from without. He
who strove to propitiate her, had to bear
his ill-success complacently,—for fear of
worse,—and accept her permission to
come again at eleven o'clock. She had
the satisfaction of making things go
her own way without any extraordinary
effort; and though it could not be objected
that she was rude, she contrived never once
to address her interlocutor as " Monsieur le
Vicomte."
<!-- Leaf 40 -->
  
  CHAPTER II.  
  
  
  THE MARRIAGE PORTION.

Madame Jean had barely witnessed the
retreat of her enemy, for such it appeared
he was, however innocently, when she
became aware that her master was calling
her from within. She shut the house-door,
and, putting down her basket in the passage,
went up-stairs to a room on the first-floor,
whence the voice issued. Opening a door
to the right, she stood in Monsieur Prevost's
presence.  
  
  
  He was standing close to a large table
<!-- Leaf 41, Page: 23 -->
covered with account books and papers, and
he held an open letter in his hand.


Martin Prevost was about sixty-two or
three, and though he looked strong and
bien conserve, still he looked his age.
He was above the middle height, gaunt
rather than spare, with a bony frame, an
immense hook-nose, and two small, sharp
eyes, quite close together. There were
about him all the signs of power of an
inferior order; power of plodding, power
of endurance, and capacity of privation,
and the unfailing marks of
acquisitiveness,—the rapacious eye and hand. " Look
at that," he said, in an angry tone, as he
thrust into Madame Jean's fingers the open
letter he held in his own; "the fellow has
just been here, and I have told him that
if he can't clear himself of these accusations
<!-- Leaf 42, Page: 24 -->
he must go. I wash my hands of him. I'll
have no quarrels with the Administration.
He shall be turned out."


Meanwhile Madame Jean read the letter,
which ran thus:—


"Sir and honoured Colleague"
(Monsieur Prevost had been the mayor of D 
three years before, and the present man
was his successor),—" I think it right to
warn you of the irregularities of the man
named Prosper Morel, in your employ.
As you are aware, he has no permis de
chasse this season, but I have every reason
to believe he steals game in the night-time.
The garde, Francois Lejeune, is morally
convinced of having seen this individual
committing his malpractices, though he
has hitherto contrived to escape being taken
<!-- Leaf 43, Page: 25 -->
in flagrante delicto; and Monsieur Riviere
has already twice complained of him to me
officially. As the man is employed by
you, and as nothing would give me greater
pain, sir and honoured colleague, than to
have to take any steps annoying to you,
I venture to beg that you will
admonish him and force him to renounce
his malpractices, in default of which I
should be obliged to proceed with a
rigour I should deeply deplore, and set
the gendarmerie in action.  
  
  
  " I remain, &c,  
  
  
  "Simon Collot, Mayor."


When Madame Jean reached the word
gendarmerie, she for certain excellent
reasons which we shall know later, curled
her lip in disdain, and muttered something
<!-- Leaf 44, Page: 26 -->
unintelligible, but which seemed to imply
that she knew better than to indulge in
the slightest alarm respecting the gallant
body of defenders of the state.


"Now look you here, Sophie," said
Monsieur Prevost, when his prime-minister
had concluded her perusal of the
administrative appeal, " my mind is made up.
Prosper Morel goes about his business
at the end of the month. I'll have
nobody of his kind about me; it
compromises one's position. It's intolerable;
he shall leave at the end of the month."


Madame Jean shook her head. " He's
been here sixteen years," objected she.


"What does that matter?" retorted
her master.  
  
  
  " His wife was the little one's bonne."  
  
  
  " That has nothing to do with it."
<!-- Leaf 45, Page: 27 -->

\"No;—I know it hasn't," observed
the woman, " nothing at all;—only she
saved his life when he had the typhus
fever, and lost her own by catching it."


"What the devd has that in common
with her husband?" growled Martin
Prevost. " The woman's dead."


\"Yes; but how is the man to gain his
bread if he leaves here ? " persisted Madame
Jean. " He's at home a long way off,
down in Basse Bretagne, and he's got no
home at aU when he gets there."  
  
  
  "He must beg," replied Martin Prevost.


"Begging's forbidden by law,"
answered Madame Jean. " He must steal or
he must starve."


\"WeU, he must go, that's certain,"
rejoined her master.  
  
  
  Madame Jean fixed a hard, bold look on
<!-- Leaf 46, Page: 28 -->
old Martin Prevost, and though the look was
both bold and hard, it was a far better one
than that which shot from his keen ferret

eyes, and he quailed before it.


\"Prosper Morel is a dangerous man," said
she authoritatively.


\"Bah ! " grumbled Monsieur Prevost;
\"a man without a sou is never
dangerous."


"You mistake," replied Madame Jean,
"a man with ever so little money is not
dangerous, but a man with none at all is;
and I tell you, beware of Prosper Morel;
don't cast him off, give him another chance."
In everything Madame Jean seemed used to
have her own way. She apparently ruled
and governed, and when she retired from
her master's presence, it was settled that
Prosper Morel should be severely lectured
<!-- Leaf 47, Page: 29 -->
by both Monsieur Prevost and herself, but
that he should retain his office of bucheron,
and the abode it secured to him in the
forest, on condition of good behaviour in
future.


While this discussion was going on
upstairs, another little scene, in immediate
connection with it, was being enacted on
the ground-floor. The window of a room
at the back of the house, looking over a
paved court, and beyond that to the garden,
was open, and seated at it was a young man,
in a well-padded arm-chair, listlessly ancl
lazdy smoking a cigar. A shadow fell
across him, projected by the figure of a man
who passed in front of the open window,
and touched his cap as he did so.


\"Good day, Prosper," said the young man
in an indolent tone of voice.
<!-- Leaf 48, Page: 30 -->

\"Salut, Monsieur Richard," mumbled the
other, and went his way.


\"Prosper," called the young man, " when
wdl you bring me down those rods ? The
weather isn't at all bad for fishing, but my
rods are all too short."


The man turned round, came back, and
stood right in front of the window. He
was decidedly disagreeable to look at,
slouching, ungainly, clumsdy put together. You
could not help comparing him to those
unfinished animals which are shown to us as
nature's first efforts before the flood. He
did not look bad, but unpleasant,—an
incomplete product, with the mud and slime of
that jelly period sticking to his features and
limbs.


"I can't bring you the rods, Monsieur
Richard," said he, in a thick, drawling voice,
<!-- Leaf 49, Page: 31 -->
\"for I am going away,—going for ever.
Monsieur up there"—and he gave a jerk
with his thumb in the direction of the
first-floor—"has turned me away."  
  
  
  " What for ? " inquired Monsieur Richard.


The man scratched his head, and looked
more hopelessly stupid than before. " Oh,
histoire de rien ! " he drawled out; " histoire
de Monsieur le Maire."


"Nonsense, Prosper," argued the young
man, laying his cigar on the window-sill;

"you can't go."


\"I am going, Monsieur Richard," he
rejoined; " but " and everything in him
seemed, as it were, to set at that moment;
lips, eyebrows, and hands, stiffened into an
expression of brutish revengefulness that
was stdl more stupid than threatening.
Decidedly the ruling characteristic of the
<!-- Leaf 50, Page: 32 -->
man was blockheadedness. I can find no
other term.


\"Nonsense, Prosper; hold your tongue ! "
rejoined Monsieur Richard. " Come round
here into my room and tell me all about it.
I must set you right with my uncle."


The man did as he was bid, and
slouchingly skulked off to the back entrance. Aud
certainly Monsieur Richard did look a likely
person to make peace between people. He  
  
  
  was so very blond and gentle-looking; not

strong, decidedly, as Madame Jean had
stated of him, but with an air of
goodnature and delicate health that made you
pity him and account for the evident
laziness—it was more than indolence—of his
nature.


As eleven o'clock was striking Monsieur
le Vicomte came, and claimed the audience
<!-- Leaf 51, Page: 33 -->
that had been promised him by Madame
Jean, who was graciously pleased herself to
introduce him into the same room on the
first-floor in which we have already been
made acquainted with the master of the
house.


This room was Martin Prevost's
sanctuary. In it were assembled the several
objects of his dearest care,—his
correspondence, his account-books, and his safe. That
same caisse de surete was about the only
indication that Monsieur Prevost had ever
allowed himself to afford to the outer world
of his riches; and, naturally, legends had
taken it for their basis in the little world of
»
D It had come all the way from
Paris, and fabulous sums were mentioned as
its price. This infinitely annoyed Martin
Prevost, and if he could have kept his wealth

<!-- Leaf 52, Page: 34 -->
securely in his cellar, he would have done
so gladly. Of course his natural instinct, as
is that of his entire class, was to bury it, to
hide it, but education and the age having
left their impress on him, he resisted this
impulse; and, sure enough, there in that
safe were all Martin Prevost's securities,
bonds, shares, obligations,—and cash.


Well; his visitor entered, and sat down,
ancl having something really important to say,
began—as in that case people invariably do
—by speaking of something utterly
unimportant, and irrelevant to the matter in
hand.


There they were, face to face; the
grandson of the Swiss valet de chambre and the
"son of the crusaders;" and, ma foi! if
the truth must be told, there was very little
to choose between them as to mere external
<!-- Leaf 53, Page: 35 -->
aspect. Monsieur de Verancour was not by
any means aristocratic looking; not a bit
of a Francois Premier, or a Marechal de
Richelieu, or a Lauzun, or any other type of
the fiery grace and brilliant corruption of
the past;—not an atom about him of. the
pale, tall, worn-out, exquisite old gentleman
whom romanciers, as a rule, oppose to
bullheaded blown-out boursiers, as the true
representatives of an era you would fancy
they deplored;—not a sign of aU this in
Monsieur le Vicomte. He was rather of the
bull-headed type himself, and instead of
having an aquiline nose, which, to be
truthful, Martin Prevost had, his nose was a
thick, stumpy nose; the black hairs which
encircled his bald crown were bristles; his
face was broad, and its colouring red-brown;
his figure was stout and not very tall; and
<!-- Leaf 54, Page: 36 -->
his hands were ugly, and the nails not clean.
His dress was slovenly, and he looked like a
man who used his limbs a good deal, and
lived much in the open air in all weathers.
His age was not much past fifty.


Between these two men, one made and
the other marred by '89, was there then any
difference at all ? More than you suppose,
but quite other than you think. For the
present, we wiU go no further than mere
manner. As they sat there opposite to each
other, Martin Prevost seemed to have in
many respects the advantage of the two, but
he lacked one thing which the Vicomte had,
and that one thing was ease.


After having exhausted the subject of
pears;—old Prevost was a pear fancier, ancl
the orchard at the Chateau was supposed to
possess some wonderfully fine specimens of
<!-- Leaf 55, Page: 37 -->
almost extinct sorts;—Monsieur de
Verancour suddenly plunged into the subject for
which he had so impatiently sought the
present interview.


"You are curious to know the business
which brings me to you to-day?" said he
with a smile. Old Prevost bowed stiffly, as
though he wished to mark that he was not
curious at all. " Well, I have a great secret
to tell you, and I rely entirely on your
discretion, for such things must not be talked
about. I am going to marry my eldest
daughter "


\"To Monsieur de Champmorin," inter
rupted old Prevost in a freezing tone.


The Vicomte was very near giving a
visible start, but did not do so.


"You really are a magician ! " exclaimed
he with a laugh, "but all the same I count
<!-- Leaf 56, Page: 38 -->
on your discretion; these things must not
be talked about till they are absolutely

settled."


"Ancl this is not absolutely settled,"
added old Prevost, half interrogatively, and
fixing his two small keen eyes on his
visitor.


\"Well,—a marriage is only settled when
the bridal mass is chanted," replied the
Vicomte, evasively.


\"Monsieur de Champmorin has thirty
thousand francs a year now," continued
Martin Prevost, not unloosing his piercing
gaze from his hearer's countenance. " He
will have at his uncle's death a house in
Paris, in the neighbourhood of the General
Post Office, that will give him. fifteen
thousand francs more, because that he will
divide with his sister; the uncle leaves to
<!-- Leaf 57, Page: 39 -->
both alike; but he will have his grand-aunt's
property all to himself at her death;—she's
near eighty now;—and Saulnois, if itwas only
decently attended to, ought to yield
five-andtwenty thousand francs a year net. So you
see thirty and fifteen are forty-five; and say
only twenty,—because of course he'll farm
Saulnois ill!—that makes sixty-five
thousand francs a year, first and last. Monsieur
de Champmorin is out and out the best parti
in the department. Have you any objection
to make to him ?" Martin Prevost asked
this question, fixing his eyes still more like
screws into the features of the Vicomte's
face; and then, before giving him time to
answer, " I know it has been said he drinks,
and is violent, and ill brought up, and lives
only with his farm servants," he went on;
—"but that would hardly be objected to.
<!-- Leaf 58, Page: 40 -->
Mademoiselle Felicie is very clever, and so
saintly a person that she would perhaps win
him into better conduct;—and then, in your
society man and wife have so little need to
be together! If les convenances are
satisfied, that is the essential point,—the rest is
only of consequence in our class, in little
humble households;—but do tell me; you
surely have no objections to make to
Monsieur de Champmorin ? "


No! the truth had to come out, whole
and entire. Monsieur de Verancour had no
objection whatever to make to Monsieur de
Champmorin; but Monsieur de Champmorin
made one small requirement of him,—
namely, that that most accomplished and
most saintly person, Mademoiselle Felicie,
should have a dot of some sort or kind. It
had to come out, and it did come out, drawn
<!-- Leaf 59, Page: 41 -->
bit by bit, but wholly and to the last morsel,
by the pressure of Martin Prevost's able and
pitdess hand.


\"So you would mortgage Les Grandes
Bruyeres; would you?" he abruptly asked
when he knew all he wanted to know.
\"Well, Monsieur le Vicomte, you are best
able to say what income that valuable
property yields you;" and Monsieur Prevost
commented upon these words with a smile
imperceptibly ironical.


\"Les Grandes Bruyeres was the most
valuable portion of my great-grandfather's
whole estate in this part of the country,"
replied quietly Monsieur de Verancour.


"Was,—yes, granted; but what is it
now ? What does it yield you ? "


"Oh, me? That is altogether another
thing. I am too poor to farm such a
<!-- Leaf 60, Page: 42 -->
property as it ought to be farmed; but you
know what the land at Les Grandes
Bruyeres is worth, my dear Monsieur
Prevost;" and in his turn the Vicomte fixed
his eyes upon his interlocutor in a way that
the latter did not find agreeable. The real
truth of the matter was this: the
bridegroom-elect of Mademoiselle Felicie had,
after much discussion with his notary, and
as much more between this functionary and
the future father-in-law, agreed to limit his
pretensions to the sum of sixty thousand
francs, moyennant quoi, he was content to
take Mademoiselle Felicie " for better, for
worse." It was a miserably small sum,—
not three thousand pounds of English
money,—and any one might see how, with
his " hopes and expectations" and thirty
thousand francs a year in hand, Monsieur de
<!-- Leaf 61, Page: 43 -->
Champmorin was letting himself go
dirtcheap at such a price. It was a splendid
\"placement" for Mademoiselle Felicie;
every atom of advantage was on her side.
Words failed wherewith to paint the
generous disinterestedness of Monsieur de
Champmorin; but then, as his notary
remarked,this was a "love match." Such
was the excuse urged, when this
bridegroom, in such high financial condition,
consented to be purchased for the paltry
sum of sixty thousand francs! And the
public were expected to adopt his view of
the transaction, and call it a "mariage
d'amour! " But unluckily Monsieur de
Verancour had not the sixty thousand francs
to give! Do what he would, he could not
scrape them together. This, however, led
merely to prolonged discussion and to the
<!-- Leaf 62, Page: 44 -->
acceptance of another form of payment by the
Champmorin notary. Instead of the capital
paid down, M. de Verancour was to pay the
annual interest upon it to his daughter, who
was to receive three thousand francs a year,
£120, paid quarterly,—£30 every three
months! Well, it was a cheap price for a
husband, if you come to think of it! But
now came the difficulty; how to raise the
money !—Martin Prevost! There was the
solution ! And so Monsieur le Vicomte came
to Martin Prevost, and had to tell him all,
and leave not one little corner of his
domestic embarrassments, however humiliating
they might be, unrevealed. It had to be
done, or ad chance of placing Mademoiselle
Felicie was at an end. At the end of half
an hour, then, Martin Prevost held the
destinies of the Verancour family in his hands.
<!-- Leaf 63, Page: 45 -->

The point at issue was this:—the property
of Les Grandes Bruyeres was worth one
hundred and fifty thousand francs any day
to a man less poor than the Vicomte;—
worth that to be sold, and worth that for the
income it would yield to any one capable of
farming it properly. But to M. de
Verancour it was worth nothing, or worse than
nothing; and his was the position of so many
thousand needy landholders in France, to
whom their land is a dead weight instead of
a source of gain.


The long and the short of it was, that
Martin Prevost, refusing inflexibly to lend
one farthing upon any security whatever,
and all idea of a mortgage being at an end,
condescended at last to promise to purchase
Les Grandes Bruyeres for the sum of
seventy thousand francs, the " odd ten"
<!-- Leaf 64, Page: 46 -->
being destined to the trousseau and
inevitable marriage expenses. But how they
had haggled, before they got to this
conclusion, they alone can understand who have
had the misfortune to be mixed up in France
with "marrying and giving in marriage."


\"But why not at once give Mademoiselle
Felicie her dot of sixty thousand francs,
since I buy Les Grandes Bruyeres, and you
get the money ? " inquired old Prevost.


\"Because with half the sum I can
quintuple it in a year," replied the Vicomte
sagaciously.


\"Ah ! " drawled out old Prevost; " you
can quintuple it, can you ? Well, I wish I
knew that secret! But you gentlefolks have
a vivacity of intelligence that is surprising
sometimes to us mere plodders and
hardworking bourgeois."
<!-- Leaf 65, Page: 47 -->

\"I must not teU you yet," resumed
Monsieur de Verancour, with an air of
diplomatic importance, "but there is an affair
about to be launched that will make million
naires of all those who are connected with it;
I have friends at the head of it, and—" he
stopped suddenly, as though on the brink of
violating some awful secret; " and when
the time comes," he resumed, " I will try to
interest you in it too."


\"Serviteur; " answered old Prevost, with
a profound bow. " I am infinitely obliged."


Just as Monsieur de Verancour got up
to go, the money-lender spoke again.
\"There seems to me to be one little
difficulty about your arrangements, Monsieur
le Vicomte," murmured Martin Prevost
blandly; "you will pay to Madame de
Champmorin the yearly sum of three
<!-- Leaf 66, Page: 48 -->
thousand francs, but when you come to marry
Mademoiselle Genevieve you will have to
do precisely the same thing. She can force
you to do it by law. What will you dispose
of then ? I may be dead by that time, and
you may perhaps not find any one so anxious
to do you a service." He called the
operation he had just been engaged upon by this
name!


Monsieur de Verancour turned round,
and with a broad frank smile, " Vevette! "
echoed he; " oh ! Vevette will never marry.
Vevette will go into a convent at her
majority. It will be impossible to prevent
her; and if she should change her mind,
why, I shall by that time be able to give
her such a dot as will enable her to marry
a duke and a peer."  
  
  
  " Well, by that time I shall probably be
<!-- Leaf 67, Page: 49 -->
dead," again repeated old Prevost, following
his visitor to the door of the room; " but
don't forget Mademoiselle Vevette. She is
a very charming young lady, and the law will
force you to give precisely the same
advantages to the two sisters."


When Monsieur le Vicomte de Verancour
was in the street, and trudging home as fast
as he could, in order to write by post time
to the Champmorin notary that all was
made smooth now for the " placing " of his
daughter Felicie in her most romantic "love
match," he never once asked himself what
impeded old Martin Prevost to take such a
lively interest in the destiny of his daughter
Vevette.

  CHAPTER III.  
  
  
  THE SISTERS.

The Chateau, as it was termed, more often
derisively than otherwise, had really once
upon a time been the seignorial residence of
D, but the ancestors of the
Verancour family were not its possessors then. It
had come to them by marriage. Somewhere
about the end of the sixteenth century a
daughter of the house of Beauvoisin, the
chief of which was the then chatelain and
lord of D, had been given in marriage
by Henry IV. to the son of a recently
ennobled echevin of Angers, whose riches,
<!-- Leaf 69, Page: 51 -->
acquired no one precisely knew how, were
regarded by the practical monarch as a
sufficient compensation for want of birth. Both
sides—Beauvoisins as well as Verancours
—were Protestants, but after that historical
mass to which the Bearnois so promptly
made up his mind as the price for the Crown
of France, Verancours and Beauvoisins, and
the greater part of their families, went all in
a heap together back again into the
venerable bosom of Mother Church. Of the old
Beauvoisin race there were soon none left.
They had dated from before the Crusades, and
had never been anything but warriors, who,
being inapt at learning any useful art or
trade, had been absorbed by those who
could. It was an act of grace and honesty
on the part of the Verancour people that
they did not assume the name of the extinct
<!-- Leaf 70, Page: 52 -->
family, but they assumed a vast deal more
than its pride, and a more over-bearing set
never were known. Their own name, their
patronymic, dating from the thirteenth
century, was Saunier; which made it probable
that some ancestor of theirs had originally
dug or traded in salt from the salt-marshes of
Brittany; but of this name, which,
associated with that of Verancour, they had
borne under the Valois kings, all trace was
rubbed out even in their own memories.
They were " sons of crusaders " to all
intents and purposes, had grown prejudiced
precisely in the inverse ratio to their power,
and were landed in this hard high-pressure
nineteenth century of ours with all the
attributes and incapacities belonging to races
whose raison d'etre is no more.  
  
  
  There was an enormous difference between
<!-- Leaf 71, Page: 53 -->
these last descendants of the Sauniers de
Verancour and theu- own great grandfathers
of the Court of Versadles. These people
believed in themselves, whilst the others
made believe to do so. The wealthy
"ennoblis" of the times of Louis XIV.
and Louis XV. shared with a large number
of grand seigneurs the consciousness of the
surprise their own fathers would have felt
at seeing the grandeur they had achieved.*
Whereas after the destroying angel of '89
had jumbled the old and the new into one
uniform mass, leaving no particular sign to
any individual victim, aU came together at the
resurrection of 1815,—above all, too, after


* The Due de Gesvres (Potier), for instance, who upon
one occasion at Court, addressed thus one of his
colleagues:—" M. le Due! what would our fathers in
heaven say, if they could see us where we are ? "
<!-- Leaf 72, Page: 54 -->
the grand tragi-comedy of the Empire,—as
equal. From the equality of suffering they
inferred the equality of caste, and swamping
any minor differences, agreed to set
themselves apart from the rest of their fellows.


To this plan the smallest provincial
families, totally oblivious of their origin,
adhered with marvellous tenacity, and what
is more marvellous still, the rest of the
world did its best to take them at their

word. The priests honoured them, society
tempted them, the really Ulustrious houses
of the land intermarried with them, all
governments coquetted with them, the
peasantry sneered at them, and the
bourgeoisie abhorred them, as if they sprang
indisputably from Brahma's eyebrow or
Jupiter's thigh. Whatever might be the
purity or impurity of the blood in their
<!-- Leaf 73, Page: 55 -->
veins, they fully enjoyed the advantages
and disadvantages of the position they
attributed to themselves, and in many
instances gave extraordinary examples of
self-renunciation and of sacrifice to what
they termed the respect for their names.
Our friend, the worthy Vicomte de
Verancour, was a fine specimen of his kind, of
what he called his " order." He really
was allied to whatever was noblest, not
only in his department, but as far away
as that magnificent temple whereof they of
the Parisian Faubourg St. Germain are the
high priests. He was very poor, had been
obliged to educate poorly, and had
condemned to many privations, his two
daughters, whom he dearly loved; but he
looked upon his poverty as a distinction,
and thought it was his duty to behave as
<!-- Leaf 74, Page: 56 -->
he did, and that it was incumbent upon him
at any cost to be what he called "true to
his name."


The chateau at D might, ages ago,
have been an agreeable abode, when its
possessors had wealth sufficient to procure
what were the relative comforts and luxuries
of the period, but it was a miserable place
for two young women to inhabit in our day.
Built, as are often baronial castles in the
west of France, considerably below the
village or town dependent upon it in days
of yore, its first unavoidable evil was
dampness, and want of air on all sides save one.
It was decidedly unwholesome;—no one
denied that. Then, although it was not
large of its kind, it was much too large for
its inhabitants, and they had to huddle
themselves into holes and corners, where
<!-- Leaf 75, Page: 57 -->
the torn and soiled furniture that had
escaped the outrages of the past could be
turned to the best use. Women, and more
than any other, French women, can contrive
to make something out of nothing, and by
the time the two Mesdemoiselles de
Verancour had been six months home from their
convent at Poitiers, they really had
converted the set of rooms appropriated to
themselves and their father on the
groundfloor into a presentable suite of chambers
for a family of reduced means. There was
enough of discomfort, as we Enghsh people
might think,—you habituaUy entered the
house through the kitchen, and in the
Vicomte's study you would be suddenly
reminded by the faU of something soft and
plump upon the floor of the presence of
frogs; but resignation was the virtue of this
<!-- Leaf 76, Page: 58 -->
family, and it was thought the right thing
to submit to everything for the sake of 
what it might puzzle you or me to specify
distinctly, but they knew, and were satisfied
with their own magnanimity.


I have said that there was one side of the
chateau which was open to the winds of
heaven, and on that side a tolerably broad
terrace, planted with acacias, lime and nut
trees, delightfully cool and shady in summer,
was the open-air boudoir of the two sisters,
Felicie and Genevieve, or Vevette, as she
was by abbreviation usually called. This
had originally formed part of the castle
ramparts, and had been one of the outworks
meant to defend the town and fortress of
D against any inroad on the part of the
Bretons. If you crossed over the broad
stone parapet on one side, you could see
<!-- Leaf 77, Page: 59 -->
down straight into a well-kept lane which
led round the castle premises up to the
town, and branched off about half a league
lower down from the high road to Cholet.


It was a bright beautiful October
afternoon, a few days after the Vicomte's visit
to Martin Prevost. The two sisters were
sitting at the stone table at the end of the
terrace. Baskets full of work and working
materials were before them. The trees
overhead were rich in their russet clothing, there
was not a breath of wind stirring, and the
warm soft sunlight flooded the meadows and
pasture lands that spread out in front, and
beyond the limit of the chateau's present
domains.


"Is that the Angelus already?" asked
Felicie, Ustening to the bell of the parish
church of D ringing out six o'clock.
<!-- Leaf 78, Page: 60 -->
\"Is Monsieur le Cure coming to supper
tonight?"  
  
  
  " I think not," was the reply.


In the provinces, and where the
womankind of such famUies as these come together,
it is impossible that a quarter of an hour
should elapse without mention being made
of a cure.


"Then suppose we look at the Monde
IUustre," observed Felicie, drawing from
the bottom of the large work-basket, where
they lay hidden, two or three back numbers
of an iUustrated journal which a cousin,
living at Tours, a lady of a worldly turn of
mind, was in the habit of sending now and
then to the two girls. " What is the
matter, Vevette; what are you dreaming
of?" she added, looking at her sister, who,
with her work laid down upon her knee.
<!-- Leaf 79, Page: 61 -->
was apparently gazing at vacancy, whilst
the tears were gathering in her eyes.


\"I was thinking of la mere Marie-Claire,"
said Vevette gently; " the sound of the
Angelus suddenly reminded me of her, and
of our convent days."


\"La mere Marie-Claire was so devotedly
fond of you, that it is no wonder you loved
her, and regret her now she's dead,"
rejoined Felicie, with rather a sententious air;
\"but, for a well-born woman, I must say,
Vevette, that a worse example can hardly be
conceived than the one she gave."


"Do you really think that, sister?"
inquired the younger girl, timidly adding with
a sigh: " Poor dear, sweet mere
MarieClaire ! how lovely she was! and how like
an angel she looked in the last few months
of her life ! "
<!-- Leaf 80, Page: 62 -->

\"Vevette !" retorted the elder sister,
with all the sternness so handsome a
"saint" could command; "pray do not
misapply terms. Mere Marie-Claire, who,
I grieve to say, was distantly related to
mamma, may have been a person to be
pitied, and we will hope she is forgiven.
Monsieur le Cure says it is allowable to
pray for her. But she was assuredly no
angel, and a more rebellious woman cannot
be imagined. Why, she actually died of it!
What made her take the veil, pray, if not
that she preferred being a nun to marrying
the man her parents had chosen for her ? "


\"But she said she could not love him,"
argued humbly Vevette.


Felicie curled her lips proudly. " What
has a well-born, piously brought up girl to
do with such reasoning as that ? " she
<!-- Leaf 81, Page: 63 -->
exclaimed. " The real fact is even worse than
what I said just now; the real fact is, that
the misguided woman took the veil because
she could not marry the man she pretended
she loved."


"But he was her equal. I believe he
was her own cousin," urged Vevette,
blushing deeply at her audacity.


"Equal, maybe," rejoined Felicie, "but
they had no money between them, and the
parents would not hear of it. No ! mere
Marie-Claire I hope repented of her errors,
but in plain terms it cannot be denied that
she positively died for love."


"And—reaUy, Felicie," murmured her
sister tremblingly, after a pause of a few
seconds, " do you think that it is so very
dreadful a crime ? "  
  
  
  "Think?" retorted the other. "Oh,
<!-- Leaf 82, Page: 64 -->
Vevette! mere Marie-Claire committed a
greater sin than I could have thought her
capable of, if in her long talks with you
she put such improper ideas into your head.
I hope you have confessed all this to
Monsieur le Cure."


\"I will," promised poor Vevette, turning
her head; " but I don't know that I ever
thought of it all so much before. I don't
know why I suddenly seemed to remember
poor mere Marie-Claire so well. It must
have been the Angelus. Do you remember
the sound of our bell at the Visitation ? "


"No indeed, my dear," answered Felicie
with a smile, and unfolding her newspapers.
\"Just look," she cried; " here is the whole
account of the Fetes of the 15th August."


\"But that's six weeks ago," objected
Vevette.
<!-- Leaf 83, Page: 65 -->

\"No matter; such things are always fresh.
There was a grand ball at the Hotel de
Ville, and here is a long description of all
the dresses." And Felicie's eye ran eagerly
down the column, and she occasionally
stopped to chronicle her admiration of some
special toUet. " Oh, this must have been
lovely!" she all at once exclaimed;
\"listen ! pink crape with water-lilies, and
the coiffure, water-lilies with pearls plaited
into the hair. I wonder who wore that ?
I wonder if she was beautiful ? When I
am married, I shall enjoy a few weeks in
Paris in the winter "  
  
  
  " Felicie ! >'


\"Why not ? It is the right thing to do.
Of course I should not go to the Hotel de
Ville baUs,—though I believe now, there
are some people who do; but our relations  
  
  
  F  
  
  
  VOL. I.
<!-- Leaf 84, Page: 66 -->
and Monsieur de Champmorin's too, in the
Faubourg St. Germain, give magnificent
fetes."


"And you will go to Paris, sister ?"
asked Vevette. " I should be frightened
out of my senses if I only set my foot in
one of its streets. Why, it is worse than
Babylon !"


\"Possibly," replied the other demurely;
\"but when a well-born woman is married
she owes a great deal to her name and
position in the world, and to her husband
and his family. She must make sacrifices
every day. All Monsieur de Champmorin's
family live more or less in Paris, and I
believe his uncle wishes him to be a Deputy.
I must think of him, and of the future
position of oui- children."  
  
  
  It was not in Vevette's gentle heart to
<!-- Leaf 85, Page: 67 -->
retahate, but in her heart she questioned
whether Felicie ought not also to betake
herself to confession, and submit to
Monsieur le Cure her strange mental
preoccupations touching pink crape dresses, and
headdresses composed of water-lilies and pearls
interwoven in the hair. Vevette rose from
her seat, and leant over the wall of the old
rampart.


\"Good evening, mademoiselle," drawled
out a languid voice from the road beneath.


\"Felicie," said Vevette, turning round,
"it is Monsieur Richard. He has got little
Chariot behind him with a basket full of
fish."


Felicie joined her sister, and with
condescending grace looked down on Monsieur
Richard. He lifted up the green leaves in
the basket, and discovered a fine fat carp.
<!-- Leaf 86, Page: 68 -->

\"That is a good big fish," he remarked
carelessly; " the rest are not worth much;"
and then deferentially raising his
broadbrimmed felt hat, made his request.
\"Would it be too great presumption,"
he asked, "if I requested the favour of
presenting my personal respects to Monsieur
le Vicomte some day soon, before leaving
D ?"


"Dear me!" Monsieur Richard, rejoined
Felicie, " are you about to leave D—— ?
Has Monsieur votre oncle obtained some
Government situation for you?"


\"Not that," was the answer, " but my
uncle is kind enough to think that at
threeand-twenty it is well to see something of
the world, and I am going to Paris for
some months."  
  
  
  "To Paris!" ejaculated both the sisters
<!-- Leaf 87, Page: 69 -->
at once. "Will you not be dreadfully lonely
without any friends or acquaintances? In
such a place as Paris, what will you do
with yourself?"


"Well," retorted the young man, " I do
not think anybody with plenty of money to
spend is likely to remain long lonely in Paris,
and my uncle has been very generous to me."


"Indeed," said Felicie. "Well, I am
sure I wish you success, Monsieur Richard.
Any day before breakfast you can come to
the Chateau. I daresay papa will receive
you. Bon sou-."


The day was waning, and the two girls
gathered up their work, Vevette carrying
the basket.


\"The idea of that old Prevost sending his
nephew to Paris!" remarked Felicie. "I
wonder what will become of him!"
<!-- Leaf 88, Page: 70 -->

\"But you know, don't you, that he is to
be enormously rich?" remarked Vevette.


"What they call rich," added scornfully
her sister.


"What any one would call rich," urged
Vevette. "Why, Felicie, they say old
Prevost has above a hundred thousand
francs a year, and he will leave every penny
to Monsieur Richard. You'll see he'll marry
one of the daughters of those nouveaux
riches, and buy all D one of these fine
days."


\"A hundred thousand francs a year,"
repeated musingly Felicie, as they prepared
to enter the house. " He'll give his wife
diamonds and run horses at the races."
And then she sighed, and said devoutly,
\"What a horrible state of things !"
<!-- Leaf 89 -->
  
  CHAPTER IV.  
  
  
  MARTIN PROVOST'S AMBITION.

A week passed by. It was the 12th of
October. Old Prevost had called his nephew
into his room, and there the two sat
together, on either side of the long
bureautable, while the legendary " caisse de
surete " raised its cumbrous shape between
the two windows, right in front of Monsieur
Richard, whilst his uncle sat with his back
towards it.  
  
  
  There was no resemblance between them;
-not one single trait in common had they.
<!-- Leaf 90, Page: 72 -->
The uncle's hard, sharp, vulture-like features
were not reproduced in the rather weak
mould in which those of the nephew had
been cast. The old man's thin lips were
very different from the full, red, sensual
mouth of the young man opposite to him,
and his piercing eyes utterly outshone
Monsieur Richard's mild blue ones, with
their rather vague, wandering glances. One
thing was a pity; Monsieur Richard's
eyelids were delicate, and every now and then
got inflamed, which took from the
pleasantness of his aspect, for he really was
otherwise what may be termed good-looking.
There was, if you will, a certain dulness in
his air; I won't say that he looked exactly
stupid, but there was a total absence of light
about him. You would swear that if he
had been in the place of any of his elders
<!-- Leaf 91, Page: 73 -->
of the Prevost stock, he would never have
known how to make the fortunes they had
made. No; stiff, sharp old Martin Prevost,
as he sat there, straight-hacked and all of a
piece, was the evident superior of that
fairhaired, round-faced, delicate young man.
But then this is a degenerate age, and the
money having been made by wiser, stronger
men, it was enough that the mediocre but
truly amiable inheritor of it all should
make a good use of it;—and that Monsieur
Richard undoubtedly would do.


\"Now that I have given you most of the
necessary detaUs about your stay in Paris,
and the principal friends you will find
there," said old Prevost, continuing a
conversation begun some half an hour before,
"it is necessary that I should inform you
of what my plans for your future are."
<!-- Leaf 92, Page: 74 -->

\"Any that you form I shall follow,"
replied the nephew with a bow.


\"Yes," answered the old man as blandly
as it lay in his nature to do. "I have never
had any complaint to make of you, Richard;
you have always been obedient and
wellconducted; and though you have no turn for
affairs, I consider you thoroughly capable
of doing credit to the position I have
achieved. You start from where I leave
off, Richard. I remain a plodding plebeian.
You must be a gentleman. You must
complete yourself by marriage. I have told you
ever since you were a boy of fifteen to
look forward to that. I have told you to
familiarise yourself with the people down
at the Chateau as much as you could. Well!
why do you shake your head ?"  
  
  
  " Because, dear uncle, I have tried, but
<!-- Leaf 93, Page: 75 -->
they won't let me! They are fanuliar
enough with me, for that matter, but it is
the familiarity that is used towards an
inferior."


\"They don't know how rich you are,"
interrupted old Prevost.


Monsieur Richard shook his head again.
\"To say the whole truth," he added, " the
Vicomte treats me like a lacquey."


"Bah!" broke out old Prevost with a
fierce bitterness of contempt, " they would
marry a lacquey if he only brought them
money enough. I tell you, nephew, you
shall be Monsieur le Vicomte's son-in-law.
I am in treaty now for the domain of
Chateaubreville down in the Mayenne, and
before the year is out you shaU be Monsieur
Prevost de Chateaubreville, and your noble
spouse,"—this was said with a sneer,—
<!-- Leaf 94, Page: 76 -->
\"shall do the honours of your house to the
whole department. I do not destine you to
be a Deputy, Richard. I mean to keep that
for myself," and the old man looked as he
spoke capable of sterner efforts than are
required to compel the attention of the
Corps Legislatif. " I will be the Deputy,
you shall be of the Conseil-General. Who
knows ? President of it, perhaps. Money
will do anything! And I will carry
through the direct line of railway from
Paris. When once we've got that,—besides
the new coal-fields,—it shall be my fault if
any of the new men in Paris,—were it even
the Pereires themselves,—are richer than
me. But the first thing is your marriage."


Monsieur Richard's eyes had been
actually flashing light all this whUe, as he
listened to his uncle's words. He knew
<!-- Leaf 95, Page: 77 -->
old Prevost's indisputable capacity, and
knew also how small men had made
enormous fortunes; and at the concluding
phrase he blushed all over with deUght.


"If it were possible, dear uncle," he
exclaimed, "it would indeed be a brilliant
dream for——"


\"Probably," interrupted the old man,
\"you've gone and formed some inclination,
as people call it, for that scornful princess;
that is of no sort of consequence;" and he
waved his hand, as if setting aside all such
nonsense; "but there is no harm in it. What
is important is that I hold those
Verancours in my hand, and that on the day after
to-morrow, on Thursday, at two o'clock, I
shall put my signature side by side with
Monsieur le Vicomte's to an act that will
make him my dependent. He has sold me
<!-- Leaf 96, Page: 78 -->
Les Grandes Bruyeres. I have had all the
acts and contracts made out. I pay him
the money at two o'clock on Thursday
next; but an hour after that I wouldn't
advise Monsieur le Vicomte to play me any
tricks, because I can destroy with one word
the entire combination for which he wants
the cash."


\"You know I never question you, uncle,"
said Monsieur Richard; but he looked all
interrogation.


\"No; you are exceedingly discreet,"
replied old Prevost, "and as the whole
concerns you, I will trust you.—The Vicomte
must have sixty thousand francs, or
Champmorin won't marry the girl. I give him
seventy thousand, and thc marriage takes
place. But by tbis proceeding he defrauds
the other sister, for he has literaUy not a
<!-- Leaf 97, Page: 79 -->
farthing left to give her. The chateau won't
sell for twenty thousand francs; and if I
show the real state of the case to
Champmorin's notary, the business is done.
Champmorin wiU withdraw, for he would have to
refund,—besides aU the eclat of the matter;
and then Monsieur le Vicomte would have
both his daughters upon his hands, and be
minus the only bit of tolerable property he
had to dispose of."


\"But, uncle ! " stammered the young
man, upon whose countenance there had
gathered all this while a cloud of anxiety
that his interlocutor did not notice. "Uncle,
I knew nothing of aU this ! Which of the
sisters is going to be married ?"


"Which?" echoed old Prevost,
impatiently. " Why Mademoiselle Felicie, to
be sure; who else should it be ? With
<!-- Leaf 98, Page: 80 -->
whom are we concerned, if not with
Vevette ? "


His nephew gasped, and, for a moment or
two, could not speak.


"Why, what ails the boy?" exclaimed
old Prevost, transfixing the unhappy
Monsieur Richard with a look that was full of
the bitterest contempt. " You haven't been
offering your hand, have you, to Monsieur
de Champmorin's charming bride; to that


?" Here he stopped short, and no
epithet came, but the expression of his
coimtenance was not complimentary to
Mademoiselle Felicie. " Richard ! " he
resumed, in a very calm tone, " you will
do well to listen to what I say : I have
decided that Mademoiselle Genevieve shall
be your wife, and on that condition I have
told you what a position you shall enjoy;
<!-- Leaf 99, Page: 81 -->
but if any obstacle to that arrangement were
to come from you, I would immediately
alter my will, and instead of being a rich
man and a personnage one of these days, you
should find yourself all at once in the
position of my grandfather when he began life.
I would not leave you one centime."


Poor Monsieur Richard was pale as death,
and seemed as though he were internally
convulsed. Externally he trembled a little.


\"Uncle," said he in an unsteady voice,
\"you never told me that you preferred one
of the sisters to the other, and "


\"Told you !" echoed old Prevost; " why
should I go explaining my intentions to
you, before the time was come to act?"


\"But, dear uncle," pleaded Monsieur
Richard, " it was not my fault if "  
  
  
  " Who cares whether it is your fault or  
  
  
  VOL. I. G
<!-- Leaf 100, Page: 82 -->
not?" retorted Martin Prevost. "One
thing be well assured of, that while I live
Mademoiselle Felicie shall never be my
niece. You idiot!" he added; "it is so
like the wretched weaklings of your kind,
the miserable products of this sensual age,
to be attracted by a girl of that description.
Why, you would not have been her husband
half a year before you would be coming
here to me whining and crying to be
delivered from her ! I know that young lady,
though she doesn't yet know herself. I
knew her grandmother, Monsieur le
Vicomte' s blessed mother, and that girl is
every inch Madame Dorothee;—la belle
Madame Dorothee! Yes, handsome she
was, God knows, and some few are living
who remember what she was besides;—all
of which didn't prevent her going to mass
<!-- Leaf 101, Page: 83 -->
every day of her life, and to confession twice
a month,—for she was by way of being a
devote, too,—though devotion was easier to
manage thirty or forty years ago than it
is now, since the reign of the Jesuits in
France."


"But, uncle," ventured to say the
unhappy youth, " Mademoiselle Felicie is not
yet nineteen, and has only been a year out
of a convent. She cannot yet "


"Nonsense!" interrupted old Prevost;
\"hold your tongue, Richard, about the
whole thing. It shall not be. And now,
as this topic must never be reverted to, I
wiU just once for aU speak my mind to you,
and you will reflect upon what I say, and
see if you can agree. You are like all the
men of your time. They call themselves
men." This was uttered with an
<!-- Leaf 102, Page: 84 -->
indescribable sneer. " You are dishonest."
The nephew started. " I don't mean that
you would steal; but you won't pay. You
want to enjoy, to enjoy always, without
doing anything else, and you want to escape
paying for it; that's what I call dishonest,
and that is the characteristic of you all.
The men of my time worked and paid its
full price for whatever they achieved. Look
at me; I've worked for forty years,—
worked hard, and plodded not only through
work, but through privations and through
humiliations. Do you suppose I should
ever have been as wealthy as I am if they
who have helped to enrich me had dreamt
I was ambitious ? No! I have been
scrupulously honest according to the present
value of the word, but I have profited by the
weaknesses of my neighbours, and I should
<!-- Leaf 103, Page: 85 -->
never have known them if I had been
thought of as anything save ' le bon homme
Prevost.' Wealth ! power even ! they don't
mind that, so long as they fancy you can
never use it to trouble their vanity. I
ambitious ! Bless my soul! I was only a
money-getting machine, a humble,
narrowminded bourgeois, who knew nothing of
politics, but only put sou upon sou and
helped his betters out of difficulties by
lending them the sums they couldn't get
elsewhere ! I, ' le bon homme Prevost!' Lord
bless you, I didn't exist! But now, my
time is come, too, and I will have my
enjoyment, for I have paid for it."


"And no one will be so rejoiced at your
success as I shall be," put in the nephew
cautiously.  
  
  
  "lam only sixty-two," continued Martin
<!-- Leaf 104, Page: 86 -->
Prevost, careless of the interruption. " I
have the strength of unspent years in store,
for I have capitaUsed my health, as well
as my money. I have fifteen years before
me, during which I will have my
enjoyment. I shaU remain, as I told you, a
plodding plebeian, but I will plod to some
purpose, and on a higher field than I have
had yet. There is the good of the empire;
the forces from below come into play now,
and the forces from above are annihilated,
though they don't see it. They get the
titles, and crosses, and Chamberlain's keys,
and their vanity is content; they have
nothing else; but we of the lower ranks
get the power. Now you see, Richard, I
will make a gentleman of you, and you
shall represent something. But I will
rule your fortunes, and wiU not have for
<!-- Leaf 105, Page: 87 -->
my niece a woman who would try to rule
me."


Monsieur Richard permitted himself a
vehement gesture of denegation.


"Stuff!" said the uncle, sternly.
"Mademoiselle Felicie was just the sort of girl
to seize hold of a weak and vicious
imagination. Don't be offended, Richard! The
imaginations of the young men of your age
now-a-days are all vicious, because the men
are all weak;—aU half-natures ! But that
is no matter. MademoiseUe Felicie will
be Madame de Champmorin in six weeks,
and when I have paid the money down
for Les Grandes Bruyeres, the Vicomte, in
spite of his pride, will not refuse me
Mademoiselle Vevette, who is really an excellent
girl, and manageable. When you come
back from Paris, Monsieur Prevost de
<!-- Leaf 106, Page: 88 -->
Chateaubreville, you shall marry her, and
when you are somewhat over forty you
will inherit all my wealth, be a persoimage,
I tell you again, and marry your own
daughters to penniless marquises or even
dukes, if you choose."  
  
  
  " Oh ! uncle, uncle !" sighed his nephew.


The countenance of old Prevost
underwent a slight change. Looking steadfastly
at Monsieur Richard,—looking at him, as
it were, through and through, he said,—
"I'll tell you what you think would be
just and proper. You think that because
you are young you ought to be able to
satisfy all your desires; you would Uke to
have the position I can give you, and the
woman you choose to fancy, besides; you
would like my earnings and your own will.
No, no, Richard, you must pay too; you
<!-- Leaf 107, Page: 89 -->
must pay by submission and by patience !
After to-morrow Mademoiselle Felicie will
be out of your reach. You must make up
your mind to it. You will have the estate
of Chateaubreville, and a DemoiseUe de
Verancour for the mother of your children,
who wiU be very rich; and what have you
done for all that?" and he took in the
whole of his nephew, as it were, at one
glance, and said, scornfuUy, "Nothing!"


Poor Monsieur Richard! He shrunk
together, and attempted no further
resistance. It might be very painful, but, as
Mephisto says, "He was neither the first,
nor would he be the last." This same
conversation has been gone through, or wdl be
gone through, by more or less every son
and every nephew in France; therefore the
hardship is after all a common one.
<!-- Leaf 108, Page: 90 -->

When the conversation was ended, poor
Monsieur Richard begged his uncle's pardon
for having dreamt of thwarting him, and
promised he would do Ms best to get over
his disappointment and accept his uncle's
plans for him with fitting readiness and
gratitude. Poor young man ! The traces
of the struggle were visible on his face,
by its increased pallor, by the redness of
his eyelids, and by a circle of dark blue
that had hollowed itself under his eyes.


All was over. Monsieur Richard was to
leave for Paris in a week, and next
Thursday Mademoiselle Felicie was to be in
possession of a dot that would enable her
to become Madame de Champmorin.


But Destiny sometimes foils even the
best calculators. When Thursday came,
old Martin Prevost was lying at the foot of
<!-- Leaf 109, Page: 91 -->
his great big iron safe, his face upon the
floor, his two arms stretched out before
him, and the back of his head beaten in
by blows. The master of the strong box
was murdered, the strong box was broken
open, and all the ready money in bank
notes and cash had disappeared. There
had been what we call burglary, and what
the French law terms "vol avec effraction."
<!-- Leaf 110 -->
  
  CHAPTER V.  
  
  
  POOR MONSIEUR RICHARD'S RICHES.

The effect produced by such a tragedy in
a little place like D, does not require
to be described. For twenty miles round it
spread its terror; but in the centre of action
itself, it exercised a vivifying power. The
coUective life of D—— was quintupled.
Every one's mind was busy upon the same
subject, and at the same time. If a
conversation began on any other topic, it was
sure, before five minutes were over, to find
its way round to the assassination of Martin
<!-- Leaf 111, Page: 93 -->
Prevost; and, whether they who conversed
were peasants or shopkeepers, you would
have been equally astonished, had you
overheard them, to note the extraordinary
aptitude of all for the discharge of duties
appertaining to the pohce. Each man,—
and, for that matter, each woman, too,—had
his or her notion about the murderer, and
was the inventor of a trap in which the
criminal must be infallibly caught, and
which, on the part of the said inventor,
proved a wiliness, a depth of calculation,
and an instinct of the manners and ways of
crime, that so far as the moral condition of
this rural population was concerned, was
not pleasant. The officers of justice only
seemed gifted with true administrative
dulness, and the process of "instruction," as
it is called, elicited, as it dragged on its
<!-- Leaf 112, Page: 94 -->
pedantic course, remarks not flattering to
judicial sharpness from the public. For the
public knew everything, however secret;
and, above all, whatever was surrounded
with unusual precautions as to secrecy.
The greffier of the Juge de Paix talked to
his wife; the Maire talked to his married
daughter; the huissier du tribunal confided
in his bonne; the doctor who had examined
the body transmitted his impressions to all
his patients; and all the devotes discussed
the matter with Monsieur le Cure and his
Vicaire. Then the beadle, who was married
to Madelon, the Maire's cook, and the
sacristan, whose wife collected the money
for the chairs during divine service, and was
charwoman twice a week at the private
establishment of the principal grocer,—all
these served as so many channels of
<!-- Leaf 113, Page: 95 -->
communication, and from conduit to conduit
conveyed the whole current of information
fiom its head source in the cabinet of the
Juge d'Instruction down to the kitchen of
the humblest menagere. But the worst of
all was the brigadier de gendarmerie. This
official, by name Frederick Herrenschmidt,
a gigantic Alsatian, was the devoted and
pretty well avowed suitor of Madame Jean;
and from " Monsieur Frederi," as she styled
him, awful as he might be to the general
public of D, she contrived to extract
the minutest details. Madame Jean was

reputed a rich woman, and being the widow
of a lazy drunkard, to whom she was
married twenty-five years back, and whose
backsUdings she had brooded over during a
twenty years' widowhood, she had never
brought herself to trust sufficiently any
<!-- Leaf 114, Page: 96 -->
\"man of woman born," to resign to him the
disposal of her little fortune. " Sophie," as
her dead master (but he alone) called her,
had been the presiding genius of the
Prevost household for a quarter of a
century, and had never cheated old Martin of
one sou. She made his interest hers,
because he made hers his; and by dint of
placing, as he had done, here a hundred
francs, and there a hundred francs of her
savings during this long space of time,
Madame Jean was possessed of somewhere
about the sum of twenty thousand francs,
and this wealth of hers was the cause that,
court her as he might, she could not make
up her mind to marry the gendarme.
Madame Jean was a fine bold specimen
of a strong-nerved French female of
fortyfive; but though her vanity was well
<!-- Leaf 115, Page: 97 -->
developed, her caution and covetousness
overtopped it. She liked to overawe the
wives and maidens of D as the sharer
of the miUtary authority of the place, and
she not only tolerated, but exacted the
utmost homage of Monsieur Frederi; but
to take him, for better for worse, was
what she could not resolve to do, for she
had a shrewd notion that however much a
union with this stalwart son of Mars might
be the better for her, it would probably be
the worse for her money. So Madame Jean,
who had no human being to leave her riches
to, and who never spent anything, but went
on saving, refused to become Madame
Herrenschmidt, but reigned supreme over the
soul of the brigadier, and was possessed
of aU the knowledge he had no business to
impart.  
  
  
  VOL. I. H
<!-- Leaf 116, Page: 98 -->

Whatever her other faults, Madame Jean
had aU the helpfulness of a Frenchwoman,
and, had it not been for her care and
activity and sense, poor Monsieur Richard
would have died, or gone mad, from the
effect of his uncle's sudden and terrible
death. Richard Prevost was no hero,—
that the reader scarcely requires to be told,
—and since it was proved to him that
the house he inhabited had been broken
into, that an assassin had actually passed
before the door of the room in which he
slept, in order to creep up the stairs and
enter his uncle's room immediately over his
head, the unfortunate young man seemed
possessed by the idea that the same thing
might happen again any day, and that the
next victim would inevitably be himself.  
  
  
  "You don't expect me to come and sleep
<!-- Leaf 117, Page: 99 -->
in your room, do you," cried Madame Jean,
hoping to rouse him by indignation, "as
Prosper's wife used to do when you were a
little chUd?"


\"Certainly not, my dear Madame Jean;
but I cannot help thinking that it would be
a proper precaution if the brigadier were to
sleep in the house."


At this Madame Jean drew herself up, as
though she had been already the gendarme's
lawful spouse, and told Monsieur Richard
that he was ignorant of the stern obligations
of le devoir mUitaire !


\"Nicolas can sleep in the passage,"
suggested she. Nicolas was the out-door man.  
  
  
  " Nicolas ? " was the distrustful reply.


"Well, you don't think he would let
himself be killed and carried away without
making a noise, do you ? "
<!-- Leaf 118, Page: 100 -->

But Monsieur Richard shook his head
and seemed to incline towards a totally
different kind of alarm, at which Madame
Jean exclaimed—" For shame ! it is
unchristianlike and unlawful to be suspecting
everybody in that way. Why, Monsieur
Richard, there's no end to that kind of
thing! You'll be suspecting me, next!
Poor old Prosper !—though I never liked
him with his nasty underhand sulky ways—
still, I do feel for him now."


\"So do I," rejoined Richard; " but you
cannot say I have done or said anything to
incriminate him; for, strange to say, from
the very first, something seemed to teU me
that the man was not guilty."


\"And I believe you are quite right,
Monsieur Richard." And, coming nearer to
him, and speaking cautiously, "I happen to
<!-- Leaf 119, Page: 101 -->
know," added Madame Jean, " that there is
not so much as the shadow of a proof;—
nay, more—there's no ground on which you
can rest even a suspicion touching Prosper
Morel. I have no business to go revealing
all this; but I do know it, and I go out of
my direct duty to tell it you because your
nerves are all jarred and out of order by this
dreadful event, and it may comfort you to
know that you have not had an assassin
going about the house. You might get into
a way of suspecting everybody. Your
nerves are terribly shattered."


\"Yes, they are; you are right there; but
surely there has been enough to shake the
nerves of a stronger man than me; and
alas! I never was strong; but I am glad
about poor old Prosper; as you say, he is
not a pleasant person; but to be accused of
<!-- Leaf 120, Page: 102 -->
such a heinous crime ! Brrrr ! " and he
shuddered all over, " that must be fearful.
Poor man ! we must try and make it up to
him somehow."


As the reader will have guessed, the first
direction taken by the suspicions of justice
was towards Prosper Morel. The man's
character, the circumstance of the complaint
made against him a week before by the
Maire and taken up so vigorously by his
employer that his dismissal had been
decided upon by the latter,—all this
naturally militated against the woodcutter, and
before the day of the murder was ended a
mandat d'amener had been made out, and
the gendarmes had arrested Prosper. They
found him at his work, a good way out in
the forest, and his behaviour at once
introduced into Monsieur Frederi's mind certain
<!-- Leaf 121, Page: 103 -->
doubts of his culpability. It was evening
when they discovered him, sitting astride
upon a newly-felled tree, whose last
branches he was leisurely lopping off, whilst
he droned out a gloomy Breton cantique to
the Holy Virgin. He was just finishing his
day's work, and preparing to go home to his
hut. When he perceived the gendarmes
before him he saluted them civiUy, and was
about to gather up his tools. They seized
him, before explaining to him why; but
when the explanation came he was stupefied,
not alarmed. The brigadier was an old
hand, and had experience in criminals, and
he felt instinctively that the bucheron was
not one. The man was stolidly unconscious,
and his complete ignorance of what had
passed was evident and undeniable.
Nevertheless, he was immediately imprisoned,
<!-- Leaf 122, Page: 104 -->
preventively, severely treated, harassed and
worried in every possible way, examined
and cross-examined, and the palpable proofs
of his innocence, which seemed to increase
almost hourly, were received with regret by
his pursuers—but they were received.
Beyond presumption, nothing pointed at
Prosper in the details of the crime,—except
that it must have been committed by some
one who was intimately acquainted with old
Prevost's habits, and with the ways of his
house.


The mode of the assassination was
tolerably clear. The victim must have been
standing in front of his safe when the blow
was dealt. The blow was dealt from behind,
and with extraordinary coolness and
certainty and force. Of the three medical men
who were called in to visit the corpse, all
<!-- Leaf 123, Page: 105 -->
were of the same opinion,—namely, that the
first blow had suspended life, and that when
the others were given, they were dealt
merely to make assurance doubly sure.
There was comparatively little blood, and
what there was had flowed downwards upon
the floor, after the murdered man had faUen.
None had spurted out, and there were no
stains on any article of furniture.


Now, as to the time at which the act was
committed, that was also easy to determine;
it must have been between the hours of six
and ten in the morning. Old Prevost was
a perfectly wound-up machine as to his
habits, and never deviated from the
monotonous regularity he had marked out for
himself. Summer and winter, he always
rose at five. At six he sat down to his
bureau, and busied himself with accounts
<!-- Leaf 124, Page: 106 -->
and calculations till eight. At eight he
sometimes took a stroll in the garden, or
even a short walk out of doors, but as often
he remained in his own room. Till ten
o'clock began striking it was not necessary
that any one should be acquainted with the
whereabouts of Martin Prevost; but when
the tenth stroke had struck from a dusty,
wheezy old clock in the passage, instantly
the voice of Madame Jean was to be heard
calling out in a loud tone, " Monsieur, the
breakfast is served."


Now, when, on that fatal Thursday,
Madame Jean's voice had sent forth its
regular caU, nothing stirred. Madame
Jean's temper was at once irritated by this
piece of unpunctuahty, and after three
minutes had elapsed she repeated the
summons. Still no answer. Madame Jean
<!-- Leaf 125, Page: 107 -->
ascended the stairs, angrUy opened the
door of her master's room, and saw the
sight we have described in our last chapter.
Her screams attracted Monsieur Richard,
who was in attendance in the dining parlour,
awaiting his uncle's presence. The poor
young man, whose nervous system was less
robust than Madame Jean's, was so
overcome by the ghastly scene, that he fainted
dead away, and Madame Jean had to raise
him as well as she could, and busy herself
with recalling him to his senses. Before
this was quite accomphshed, she had opened
a window, caUed Nicolas up from the
stabledoor in the yard below where he was
attending to the old mare, and despatched him
for the Juge de Paix and the Maire, and
the doctor, and the all-important brigadier.
As to the unhappy Monsieur Richard,
<!-- Leaf 126, Page: 108 -->
between sobbings, and spasms, and swoons,
it was long past noon before any rational
testimony could be extracted from him.


What was quickly enough reaUsed was
this smaU number of facts;—Martin Prevost
had been assassinated after he was dressed,
and had begun his daily occupations,
consequently, between the hours of six and
ten. He had been struck from behind by
a heavy blunt instrument, no trace whereof
could be found, and the blow had been
dealt with such force that the probability
was that the assassin was a man under
middle age.


He had been murdered by some one
entering the house from without, for the
mode of entrance was discovered almost
directly. At the end of the passage which
divided the house, and ran from the
<!-- Leaf 127, Page: 109 -->
streetdoor to the yard-door, there was a small
room, used for putting away everything in
general; and from old boots and dirty
linen on the floor, to fresh-made preserves
put to set in their pots on the shelves,
there was a Httle of everything in this
chambre de debarras. It had one window
opening into the yard, and a door opening
into the passage. This door was seldpm
shut, and the window was never open. But
a pane of glass had been taken out, through
which a man's hand and arm could be
introduced, and the window had been
opened, for it was left open, and what
was more, the iron bar and hasp, rusty,
and Uable to creak if suddenly turned, were
rubbed aU over with some filthy grease,
found to be borrowed from pots, kept by
Nicolas in his tool-house for greasing
<!-- Leaf 128, Page: 110 -->
cartwheels. Through that window, then, the
assassin had entered, and passing through
the door into the passage, he had mounted
the stairs up to Monsieur Prevost's room.


The reason of the crime was at once
evident; it lay in the desire to rob. But
the safe had not been broken into, as was
at first supposed. The safe had been
opened, and probably by old Prevost
himself.


But then, the ingress of the assassin
accounted for, how about his egress ?
Every fact successively discovered, pointed
to the precise moment of the crime as
somewhat before seven, for Nicolas had
been ordered, the night before, by Martin
Prevost himself, to be at the post-office
by seven, punctually, to post some business
letters, and thus gain several hours by
<!-- Leaf 129, Page: 111 -->
taking advantage of what was called the
night post, instead of waiting for the day
post, which only went out at three. He
had gone out at half-past six, and was
found not to have returned much before
eight. Madame Jean had gone, as she
frequently did, to six o'clock mass, and,
as she also frequently did, had passed from
the church into the sacristy, and had a bout
of conversation with the Vicaire, and she
was certain of having returned shortly after
half-past seven.


In one hour, then, between half-past six
and half-past seven, had the deed been
done, for the house was deserted then, and
young Monsieur Richard fast asleep, for
he slept late at all times, and, especially
since his Ulness, he scarcely ever woke
before half-past eight or nine.
<!-- Leaf 130, Page: 112 -->

But next came the question of escape.
How, at that hour, had the murderer
escaped ? The court-yard, being paved,
yielded no trace of a footmark, but in the
garden beyond there were some traces of
a boot or shoe very different from any that
could be matched by the foot of anybody
in or around the house. These traces were
lost at a hedge, then found again in a field
beyond, then utterly lost on the banks of
the river close t6 the Cholet high road.


Nothing in all this, as the reader will
see, squared the least with the notion of
Prosper Morel as the murderer. Still the
fact remained of his master having turned
him off, and of his having been heard to
threaten his master. In this, however,
Monsieur Richard was at once his best and
worst witness; for, though he could not
<!-- Leaf 131, Page: 113 -->
deny the threat made by Prosper in his
presence, yet, aided by Madame Jean, he
had been the means of bringing him back
into his uncle's service, if not favour; and
Madame Jean deposed that Prosper's
gratitude to all, and, above all, to his master,
for giving him another chance, was loud,
deep, and sincere. So said Monsieur le
Cure, who had been instructed to admonish
Prosper, and who had been, he said, edified
by the man's behaviour on that occasion.


Notwithstanding all this, Prosper Morel
was kept preventively in prison, and having
no other presumable culprit under its claw,
French law gave itself its habitual delight
in torturing, as much as possible, the one
it had caught. However, even French law
has a Umit to its harshness and
narrowmindedness, and without one single shadow  
  
  
  VOL. I. I
<!-- Leaf 132, Page: 114 -->
of a proof, Prosper's detention could not
last. The man's behaviour in prison was
irreproachable. He was mostly silent, and
absorbed in the study of a well-thumbed
book of prayers. When not silent, he
either sang his Breton cantiques or prayed
aloud for the soul of his murdered master.
None of his guardians liked him, but there
were not two opinions about his innocence.
Besides, to his credit be it spoken, Monsieur
Richard, so soon as the first shattering effect
of the crime had a little worn off, did
everything in his power to come to the bucheron's
aid; and when each succeeding examination
by the Juge d'Instruction brought forth
the increased certainty of the crime having
been committed by some one from without,
whose identity could not by any means be
brought to taUy with that of the
<!-- Leaf 133, Page: 115 -->
woodcutter, why, the woodcutter had to be
released. So one fine day old Prosper went
back to his hut, and recommenced his
avocations. But so repeUent was the man's
nature, that the having been a victim to
a false accusation did not make him
interesting. His innocence was proved beyond
all doubt, yet people shunned him as before,
and he led a solitary Use up in his woods.


The sum of ready money stolen was
found, as nearly as any retrospective
calculation could be made, to amount to about
fifteen thousand francs—five thousand and
odd hundreds in gold and sUver, and the
rest in notes. The numbers of all the notes
had not apparently been taken, although in
a Uttle side drawer of Martin Prevost's
bureau-table was found, with the date of
8th October written on it, a slip of paper
<!-- Leaf 134, Page: 116 -->
on which were marked down the numbers
of three 1,000-franc notes and of two
500franc ones. Of course the necessary
measures were immediately taken to stop these
notes, but of the others no trace could be
obtained.


Two weeks passed over, and certainly no
effort was spared. Officials came from
neighbouring towns, and the Preset of the
chef-Ueu du departement wrote to Paris
and came himself to D, and a great stir
was made; but the mystery never allowed
one corner of its veil to be lifted. There
were examples of such mysteries in the
judicial history of France, and the Prevost
murder was destined to be a fresh one added
to the list.


The person who did really create a lively
and sincere interest everywhere, was poor
<!-- Leaf 135, Page: 117 -->
Monsieur Richard. For many miles round
he was talked of and lamented over; and
particularly when it was known how very
rich he was, his neighbours fell into the
habit of caUing him, quite affectionately,
\"ce pauvre Monsieur Richard."


Of a truth, when old Prevost's affairs
came to be looked into, it was a matter for
universal surprise to see how rich he had
become. He had, for the last twenty or
thirty years, conducted his financial business
through men who did not know or
communicate with each other. But at his death
the accounts of all were forthcoming, and
the Cholet notary and a Paris notary, a
Paris stockbroker and a Paris banker, aH
produced their books, and old Prevost was
fbund to be possessed of double and treble
the property, in various securities, that had
<!-- Leaf 136, Page: 118 -->
ever been supposed. Between land and
floating investments, his fortune amounted
to near upon three millions five hundred
thousand francs ! Bundles of raUway
obligations there were, for instance, on such
lines as the Orleans and St. Germain, which
had never been touched since their creation,
and which had more than doubled.


Poor Monsieur Richard! It certainly
diminished no one's interest in him when
the notary at D produced Martin
Prevost's will, by which, subject only to
one or two smaU charges,—such as a
provision for Madame Jean, who did not need
it!—he left everything he possessed to his
nephew. Richard Prevost's income was not
far under one hundred and seventy thousand
francs a year !  
  
  
  " Indeed, sir," said the notary at D,
<!-- Leaf 137, Page: 119 -->
  
  " your poor uncle was more attached to you
than any one knows besides myself."  
  
  
  
\"And even you do not know what I lose
in losing him," said the young man. And
his last interview with his uncle seemed to  
  
  
  have so deeply impressed him as to have
almost cured him of his admiration for
Mademoiselle Felicie.
<!-- Leaf 138 -->
  
  CHAPTER VI.  
  
  
  THE LOVERS.

If the reader has not forgotten Monsieur le
Vicomte's application to Martin Prevost
touching the mortgage or sale of Les
Grandes Bruyeres, he will readily
understand the singular embarrassment in which
Monsieur le Vicomte found himself placed
when, instead of a living money-lender he
suddenly confronted the corpse of a
murdered man. Things had reached a point
when any retrograde steps would be likely
to provoke a " scandal," as provincial
<!-- Leaf 139, Page: 121 -->
newshawkers term it; and were FeUcie's
marriage with Monsieur de Champmorin to be
definitively broken off, she might at once
resign herself to the blessings of
spinsterhood, for she had few or no " extraordinary
resources," as Finance Ministers, in the face
of a deficit, term it, to fall back upon.
Felicie had got just now her one chance in
hand. She would hardly get another.
How should she ? She could not be taken
about to watering-places,—there was no
money for that sort of thing,—and she
could not even achieve a visit to Paris; for,
besides the pecuniary question, she had no
relation there who would take notice of her
unmarried, or help her to get a husband !
No; if any unlucky circumstance prevented
Mademoiselle FeUcie from becoming Madame
de Champmorin, she would simply fall back
<!-- Leaf 140, Page: 122 -->
upon her father's hands, or she would have to
make a mesalliance, and even of
that—frightful as it was !—what likelihood was there in
such an out-of-the-way place as D ?


It was altogether a dismal look-out, and
such Monsieur le Vicomte felt it to be. Of
course a man, even so hard pressed as he
was, could not, for decency's sake, attempt to
force on the discussion of his private affairs
at the moment of so shocking a catastrophe
as that of old Prevost's death. So he was
obliged to wait and postpone the settlement
with Monsieur de Champmorin's notary,
under no matter what pretext. And this
was not altogether easy. In France, when
a marriage is being negotiated, the two
persons who are to be joined together and
made one can only, tiU that junction be
operated, be fitly described as "hostile
<!-- Leaf 141, Page: 123 -->
parties." Those who act for them pass their
lives in the exercise of the cunningest
strategy, and to have " out-manœuvred the
enemy" is glorious. True ! it is a game of
\"who wins loses," for if the victory be
gained the husband or wife may be lost.


Now if the Champmorin general attained
to a full discovery of what had passed in the
Verancour camp, he would, undoubtedly,
raise his own reputation for sharpness and
address, and be confided in largely by the
fathers and mothers around, but he would
cost his client a well-born, strictly brought
up, and very charming wife. Verancour
pere knew that that consideration was a
secondary one, and he did not disguise to
himself the danger. Having explained, as
well as he could, to his adversary that his
own and his father's business had always
<!-- Leaf 142, Page: 124 -->
been managed by Martin Prevost, and that
after the latter's retirement from his office
he had preferred his advice to that of the
notary who was his official successor,
Monsieur le Vicomte contrived to obtain a
respite from his future son-in-law's
representative, and set to work to make the most
he could of old Prevost's heir.


There was no kindness, no attention, that
was not shown by the inmates of the
Chateau to poor Monsieur Richard; and, though
the quaUty of these advances was stUl of a
patronising sort, yet they were very
soothing to the unhappy young man, and he
gladly accepted them; so that, by degrees,
half his time came to be spent at the
Chateau. He never grew to feel at home with
this fanuly, but the intercourse with them
was pleasant, and took him out of himself.
<!-- Leaf 143, Page: 125 -->

With regard to Mademoiselle Felicie,
there was assuredly a strange revulsion of
feeling in young Prevost's heart and mind.
You would have thought that she frightened
him, and for the first few days of his
intimacy, if such it can be called, at the
Chateau, he almost seemed to shrink from her.
Vevette, with her sweet gentle ways, her
simple piety, and her instinct of consolation,
attracted Richard at the outset far more
than the fascinating Felicie, who had, as we
know, before the recent tragedy, made such
an impression upon him. But this did not
last; and the nephew of the deceased usurer
and that born Sœur de Charite, Vevette,
were, even when taken together, no match
for Monsieur de Verancour's eldest daughter.
Before three weeks were past, Monsieur
Richard was hopelessly secured, manacled,
<!-- Leaf 144, Page: 126 -->
and cast down enchained at the feet of the
fair enslaver; and whilst he regarded his
very adoration,—mute though it was,—as
presumptuous, it would have been hard to
say whether she condescended even to notice
that she had inspired it.


The two sisters were very different;
differing in beauty as in character and mind.
Fehcie was just nineteen, her younger sister
seventeen and a half. They were in every
respect two nearly perfect types of French
womanhood,—of those two great divisions
of the female sex in France, neither of which
do we Englishmen ever thoroughly
understand. The elder girl was a true
representative of the by far larger class, which
from Diane de Poitiers down to Madame
TalUen or to Madame Recamier, through all
the Chevreuses, Montespans, and
<!-- Leaf 145, Page: 127 -->
Pompadours of three centuries, has borne haughtily
in hand the banner of feminine courage,
activity, and intelligence, and gone unloving
through history. The younger one
personified that infinitely rarer order of women,
humble and heroic at once, who from Jeanne
d'Arc to Louise de la VaUiere, worship the
ideal, and accept martyrdom as a fitting
punishment for having loved.


There is the one characteristic common to
the two classes;—both beheve love to be an
evil, a thing unholy, and in the negation
whereof hes true sanctity. Only, whilst the
one side achieves the triumph easily, and
puts heart and soul into ambition and
intellectual pursuits, the other side yields to the
conqueror and accepts wretchedness and
death as the fitting penance for having
loved. Much of all this is owing to the
<!-- Leaf 146, Page: 128 -->
social constitution of France, somewhat more
to the influence of the clergy and their
curious interpretation of Catholic doctrines, but
most of all to the conventual and physically
ascetic education of well-bom women. But
for the pivot round which all social relations
revolve in France, and on which depend all
her immoralities, and a vast deal of her
intellectual greatness, you need look no
further than to the condemnation of love, held
to as a principle by all Frenchwomen,-—by
those who act up to, as well as by those who
are faithless to it.


Felicie de Verancour was the very
incarnation of what is called a superior woman in
France. She had latent in her all that
might make one of the most famous of her
kind. Self-possessed she was, proud, firm,
and a slave to what she believed was duty.
<!-- Leaf 147, Page: 129 -->
Such women are, in France, extolled as
high-principled because they are exempt
from all passion. Theh' worst feature is,
that they do nothing save upon calculation;
then- best, that they really are superior to
every circumstance. It is not in the power
of poverty or misfortune, or even of death
itself, to humble, or shake, or extinguish
the spirit of a lady in France. This it is
which wins for them, often wrongfully, their
fame for devotedness. Nine-tenths are
devoted to their high idea of
themselves,—which may stand instead of a virtue. The
tenth portion is devotion itself; but the
motive for the devotion is to be found in the
idea of expiation. They have loved ! There
fore they must expiate.


Felicie was the perfection of the modern
beauty of France;—small, delicate,graceVOL. I, K
<!-- Leaf 148, Page: 130 -->
ful, refined; every movement, every look,
was feline; and, once in her atmosphere,
you were magnetised. She occupied and
attracted you incessantly, raised all your
curiosity, and never for one instant
satisfied it.


As to Vevette—; but she is too well
known to be portrayed. All nations and
all ages know her. Italy calls her Juliet,
Germany Gretchen; we in England cannot
name her, for she is legion; in France only
is she rare, for she is out of the social
groove, and lives, however innocent or pure
she may happen to be, in a perpetual state
of terror and humiliation at the notion of
her sin.


Well! October was drawing to its close,
and there seeming to be no chance of the
gloomy mystery being fathomed, the
<!-- Leaf 149, Page: 131 -->
Prevost murder had ceased to be the sole
preoccupation of the public mind at D


The weather was magnificent for the
season, and, in exchange for Monsieur de
Verancour's attention to him, Richard
Prevost gave the Vicomte permission to shoot
over every acre of his land, of which
permission the Vicomte profited to the utmost
extent. FeUcie's dominion over the poor
young man had reached such a height that
he had ceased having any over himself.
He belonged to Felicie. And yet, if you
had studied him well, you must have come
to the conclusion that Monsieur Richard

was not " in love."


One evening, towards the end of the
month, Vevette was descending the little,
narrow, stony path, leading from the parish
church of D to a side entrance into the
<!-- Leaf 150, Page: 132 -->
gardens of the Chateau. She had a
prayerbook in her hand.


As she turned a corner of the old wall,
and thus was completely hidden from the
side of the town, some one came from
behind the bushes which skirted the path
towards the open country, and a voice said,
almost in a whisper, " Vevette !"


The girl stopped, and turned pale, " Oh !
how you frightened me, Raoul!" she said,
clasping her prayer-book close upon her
breast with both hands.


\"Frightened you, Vevette ! " was the
rejoinder, in a tone of more sadness than
reproach. " Alarm is not the feehng I
wish to inspire, but I must speak to you,
dearest; I must indeed."


Vevette trembled, and looked thoroughly
scared. " At this hour," she objected,
<!-- Leaf 151, Page: 133 -->
\"and so near the house. It is too
dangerous ! Suppose any one should see us.
Good heavens, Raoul, how did you come ?
why did you come here ?"


\"Vevette, dearest!" was the answer, in
a gentle tone, " I came here on foot from
MoUignon, across the fields, and I came
here because I tell you again that I must
see you. I calculated that, as this was
Saturday, you would certainly be going to
confession at your usual hour, and that as
you came home I could meet you; but you
are coming back an hour earlier than usual,
—has anything happened ?"


\"Yes," replied she; " Monsieur le Cure
has been sent for to administer poor old
Gayrard, the blacksmith, who is dying, and
he can only be in the confessional this
evening."
<!-- Leaf 152, Page: 134 -->

The young man came close to the
trembling girl, and took one of her hands in
his, which apparently increased her alarm
tenfold. "Vevette," pleaded he, tenderly,
\"we have a whole hour to ourselves. You
will not be expected home before six, and
it has not yet struck five. Now hsten to
me, darling;" and he drew closer to her
side; " there may be a certain danger in
talking here, as we are now doing; it is
not likely that any one will pass this way,
which leads only from your gate to the
church,-—still it is within possibihty; there
will be no danger at aU if you will come
down as far as the Pavilion, and let me go
in there with you."


The girl shuddered. " Into the Pavilion,
Raoul?" she exclaimed. "Why what
would become of us, if;" she
<!-- Leaf 153, Page: 135 -->
hesitated. " What would happen supposing
my father "


\"Where is your father ? " interrupted
Raoul.


\"Out shooting in the woods belonging
to La Grande Ferme."


"Oh ! his new friend, Monsieur Richard's
woods," observed he with a smile. " And
Felicie?"


\"FeUcie is at home, hard at work at
the altar carpet we are to give Monsieur le
Cure at All Saints'."


\"And, rely upon it, Monsieur Richard
is in attendance upon her," added the
young man, with an expression of bitter
disdain. " I should not be permitted to
be alone with either of you for two minutes;
but that bourgeois-mUhonnaire may pay his
corn's at all hours."
<!-- Leaf 154, Page: 136 -->

\"For shame, Raoul," retorted Vevette.
\"He has gone through such an awful trial;
and besides, poor Monsieur Richard, he is
of no consequence !"


Dming this little parley, Raoul had
managed to obtain undisputed possession
of Vevette's hand, and in the end he also
persuaded her to come with him into what
he called the Pavilion.


This was no other than a kind of
gardenhouse, built into the wall of the old
rampart. It lay immediately under the terrace
on which, some clays since, we saw the two
sisters sitting at work, and was entered
by a glass door, which opened upon a
narrow path of the kitchen-garden. A
small gate in the wall gave ingress from
the lane into the garden, and of this gate
Vevette kept the key; for it was through
<!-- Leaf 155, Page: 137 -->
it she let herself out and in, when she went
to the church or the presbytere. The only
occasions on which Vevette or her sister
ever moved about alone were these. The
church and presbytere had originally been
dependencies of the Chateau, and the small
number of servants in the Verancour
household made it convenient that sometimes

the young ladies should venture unattended
from their own garden-gate to the
sacristydoor.


In the interior of the Pavilion there were
two rooms; one rather large, the other a mere
dark closet, at the back, without a window.


When the pah- had entered and closed the
glass door, the young man threw off his hat,
and raising Vevette's hand to his lips, kissed
it silently, and with a sort of grave rapture.
She laid her prayer-book down.
<!-- Leaf 156, Page: 138 -->

What a handsome pair they were ! She
all grace, and softness, and tenderness, and
humility; and he all fire and energy, and
made, as it seemed, to protect her. Vevette
was the first to speak. He appeared to have
forgotten why they were there.


"Raoul," said she, "why have you forced
me to come here ? What have you to say
to me ? "


Holding her hand, which he took from
his Ups, in one of his, he, with the other
arm, encircled her waist, and pressed her to
him fondly. Her head just reached his
chin, and as he bent down towards her, he
could not choose but kiss her beautiful fair
hair; but he did so reverently.


\"Don't tremble so, my own," murmured
he, almost inaudibly,—for she quivered
like a leaf. " You do not, you cannot
<!-- Leaf 157, Page: 139 -->
fear me," and he drew her still closer to
him.


Vevette was all paUor, and then again all
one blush, and panting with terror and
emotion. " What wi\l become of us !" she
cried; and with a sudden, chUdlike impulse,
she hid her face upon her lover's shoulder,
and burst into tears.


Gently as a mother stills her babe did
Raoul strive to calm and pacify Vevette.
\"My very own," said he, when the first
paroxysm was over, " if you will foUow my
counsels, and if you can rely upon yourself,
all will come right. Only answer me two
questions, Do you love me, Vevette ? " and
as he uttered the words, he looked at her
with his whole soul in his eyes. She gave
no reply in words, but as her eyes sank
before his, she again hid her face on his
<!-- Leaf 158, Page: 140 -->
breast, and a tremor, a kind of electric
vibration, passed over her frame.


\"Well, then," resumed Raoul, apparently
satisfied, " wiU you consent to be bargained
away to some man you cannot love, as your
sister will be? Will you betray and destroy
me, out of weakness ? "


Vevette turned round and looked
imploringly at her lover. " What am I to do,
Raoul ? " she pleaded. " Obedience to my
father is my most sacred, my first duty."


\"No, Vevette, it is not so," interrupted
Raoul firmly. " Truth to me is now your
first duty. You have given me your heart
and soul, and you must be true to me, or be
unworthy."


"Oh! Raoul, Raoul!" wept the agonised
girl, " there is my sin; ancl for that sin we
shall both suffer ! "
<!-- Leaf 159, Page: 141 -->

"Vevette, there is your virtue, and virtue
is strength. Our love can save us, but it
must be strong. We are going to be
separated,"—this was uttered with a visible
effort. " Don't be alarmed, my sweet one;
there is no separation between those who
reaUy love. We shaU be nearer to each
other when I am in Paris and you here,
than you and any of those who are side by
side with you will be. I am not afraid of
the trial, Vevette, and therefore you need
not be so. My father sends me to Paris
to enter the offices of the Ministre de la
Marine as an unpaid clerk,—the interest of
my uncle the Admiral has achieved this
enviable position,—but that is merely the
beginning. I have another plan. I will
make my own career for myself."  
  
  
  "Raoul!" interrupted Vevette, aghast
<!-- Leaf 160, Page: 142 -->
at her lover's boldness. "And your
father!"


\"My father wUl in the end approve,
because he wUl be unable to help himself, for
I wiU distinguish myself and bring fresh
honour to his name. But that is all a
matter of mere detail, and we have not time
for it now; the one thing of importance to
us is, to be sure of each other. We are very
soon to be parted, darling. Will you wait
for me, and will you one day be my
wife?"


Vevette's look of mute despair told the
entire tale of her mistaken education.


"Will you promise me," continued Raoul,
compassionately, " to withstand all attempts
to marry you to any one else ? "


"Raoul!" exclaimed she with energy,
and as though illuminated by a sudden
<!-- Leaf 161, Page: 143 -->
inspiration, " I wUl promise you to take the
ved rather than marry any one else. That
I can do, and that I wiU do."


\"Poor child!" rejoined her lover gravely;
\"and so work out the misery and death of
both yourself and me. And this is what
they call religious teaching ! Now listen to
me, Vevette," and he put both his arms
round her.


\"Hush !" whispered she, breaking from
him hurriedly; " there is some one coming
down the path this way; we are lost!"


"Be calm, Vevette," said Raoul, with
authority; "I will hide myself there in the
dark closet. Open the door directly; meet
whoever it is with assurance, and try to
draw them away from the Pavilion."


Vevette obeyed mechanicaUy; took up
her garden hat, opened the glass door, and
<!-- Leaf 162, Page: 144 -->
found herself face to. face with Richard
Prevost.


\"Good evening, Mademoiselle
Genevieve," said he respectfully. "You are
just returned from church, I see. I was
going out this way, up the steep path,
because I have some one to see on the Place
de l'Eglise, and it is much nearer;" and he
went towards the gate in the wall.


Raoul had the key in his pocket. He
had shut it and locked it on the inside.
What was to be done? Vevette's
confusion was luckily somewhat concealed by her
large, overhanging straw hat, and Monsieur
Richard was never supposed to be very
sharp. She stammered something about the
key being lost, and in fact said at last that
she had lost it, and was afraid she should be
scolded. "It is no matter at all," replied
<!-- Leaf 163, Page: 145 -->
blandly Monsieur Richard, " we can go
round. But I thought you always went
that way. I thought you came just now
from that gate into the Pavilion."


\"I had come all the way round, but had
some seeds I wanted to look for in the
garden-house," she answered, trembling
with fear.


\"Oh ! I beg your pardon a thousand
times," said Monsieur Richard humbly.
\"I am afraid I have disturbed you."


They went back together towards the
Chateau, and Vevette let Monsieur Richard
out hy another gate, and then went into the
house herself, calm externally, but internally
convulsed with dread.


Had Monsieur Richard seen anything, or
heard voices ? What did he guess ? What
did he know ?

<!-- Leaf 164, Page: 146 -->

That evening the sisters went together to
the church, and close behind the
sacristydoor Vevette perceived Raoul. When they
went out, Vevette followed Felicie. " All
is safe," whispered a voice in her ear as
she passed, and a key was put into her
hand under her cloak. Felicie had seen
nothing.

  CHAPTER VII.  
  
  
  THE VICOMTE'S TROUBLES.

It was within two days of All-Saints' day,
when Monsieur le Vicomte went up just
after breakfast-time, to pay a visit to his
new friend and protege, as he thought
him.


Madame Jean received him with
affabiUty. She had grown gracious in her
demeanour towards the "son of the
crusaders;" for, in the firsi; place, the tragical
death of her old master had considerably
softened her, and in the next she relented
<!-- Leaf 166, Page: 148 -->
towards these ci-devants,—useless and
obstructive as they seemed to her,—because
their conduct to her young master touched
her.


She shook her head, with a sigh, in
answer to Monsieur de Verancour's inquiries
at the door. "Ah!" said she, "we are
none of us the same since then. We shall
be a long while before we get over it; and
as for poor Monsieur Richard, he really
ought to be persuaded to go away for a
short time. He never was strong, but he is
wasting away now. He ought to change
the air. He wants change of scene, change
of everything. He's in a bad way." And
with another mournful shake of the head,
she ushered the Vicomte into Monsieur
Richard's presence.  
  
  
  It was not the room that had formerly
<!-- Leaf 167, Page: 149 -->
been old Prevost's, nor even that
immediately under it, which his nephew had been
used to inhabit. It was the salon de
compagnie, as provincials term it, which
Monsieur Richard had caused to be arranged as
a kind of study, and out of which he rarely
went.


When the Vicomte entered, Richard
Prevost came forward, eagerly, to meet
him, and when they were seated he began
the conversation. " Has the shooting been
satisfactory ? " he asked. " I have done my
best, and have told the garde at the Grande
Ferme to keep a sharp look-out; but it is
hard in these parts not to share one's game
with aU the ne'er-do-wells of the
department."


"Well, yesterday I tried the woods up
there," rejoined Monsieur de Verancour,
<!-- Leaf 168, Page: 150 -->
pointing in the direction of the hill behind
the town. "In the way of hares and
chevreuils there's something to be done
certainly."


\"Ah !" remarked Richard; "in the high
timber ? yes; and if I dared put old
Prosper Morel at your orders, you might
have excellent sport. Never was there such
a traqueur as that man in the world. But
then, you see, I daren't trust him with a
gun;—you know he was complained of in
my uncle's time;—the instinct is too strong
for him. We were obliged even to have
his permit taken from him. I daren't give
you Prosper."


"Well," answered the Vicomte, in a
musing manner, " I saw the poor old fellow
yesterday up in the woods yonder, and he
looks to me terribly altered. I can't help
<!-- Leaf 169, Page: 151 -->
thinking those few days' imprisonment, and
the examinations and suspicions, and all
together, were too much for him. He
stares at you in such a strange way, and is
more absent than ever. He has quite a
moon-struck air."


"Poor man, poor man!" exclaimed
Monsieur Richard. "I do not know how
to compensate to him for all he went
through. In my poor uncle's time he used
to be down here every two days, at least;
now he scarcely comes at all. Poor old
Prosper ! "


The conversation dropped, and it was
evident that Monsieur le Vicomte had not
paid Richard Prevost this matutinal visit
merely to converse about the wrongs of the
Breton woodcutter. After a pause of a few
seconds, he began upon the matter which
<!-- Leaf 170, Page: 152 -->
was occupying all his mind. " You have
perhaps not yet had time to look for the
acts I hinted at the other day," said he,
in the most propitiatory tone he could
assume.


Richard Prevost looked as though he had
dropped from the clouds. The Vicomte
grew more insinuating still.


\"I mean the deeds of transfer your
lamented uncle had been so good as to
prepare," added he, with a smile wherein the
deepest sympathy was meant to be alhed to
the most gracious condescension. " Alas !
the papers were all to have been signed on
the very day on which " And here
Monsieur de Verancour cut his narration
short with an appropriate shudder.


\"I remember now," replied Richard.
"You aUude to the papers concerning the
<!-- Leaf 171, Page: 153 -->
sale of Les Grandes Bruyeres." The
Vicomte nodded assent. " I must beg for
forgiveness; but I have only once had the
courage to go up there again,—into that
dreadful room. I have only once looked
into my poor uncle's papers, and I found
nothing there."


\"Yes ! in truth it must be dreadful;—
dreadful! " rejoined Monsieur le Vicomte,
whose self-interest was waxing warm, and
who hardly knew how to come to his point.
\"Dreadful! shattering to the nervous
system; but we must be men,—my poor
Monsieur Richard ! —we must be men ! "


Monsieur Richard sighed. " My poor
dear uncle had agreed, I think you told
me, to purchase Les Grandes Bruyeres," he
began, with an apparent effort.  
  
  
  " For the sum of seventy thousand francs
<!-- Leaf 172, Page: 154 -->
paid down," replied Monsieur de Verancour.
\"They were to have been paid into my
hands on the fourteenth of this month,—on
the day of the murder."


Monsieur Richard turned pale, and for a
moment closed his eyes. Then languidly,
he drawled out the poor excuse which he
had to offer. " It must seem deplorably
weak to you," he said, " but to enter that
room turns me sick. I have tried, and I
am not equal to it. You see I have even
left what had been my own room since I
was a boy. I instinctively fly from all
that recalls the horrible, horrible event! "
Another pause. " My poor uncle, then,
had almost bought the property," he added,
half speaking to himself.


\"Almost! " echoed Monsieur de
Verancour. " Quite ! He had quite bought it.
<!-- Leaf 173, Page: 155 -->
The formal engagement was taken. It was
binding "


\"Not in law," interrupted Richard
meekly.


\"Perhaps not; but in honour," retorted
Verancour, becoming desperate.


\"Let us say in friendship," suggested
Monsieur Richard. " Can you,—will you
confide in me as in my poor uncle, and let
me know why the immediate sale of the
property was so desirable ?"


The Vicomte hesitated, and probably the
\"inward man " made a wry face; but the
outward one had to make the best of it,
for what else was there to do ? So he told
him all.


Monsieur Richard listened with the
deepest, most respectful, attention to the story
of which it apparently suited him to appear
<!-- Leaf 174, Page: 156 -->
ignorant; and when the tale was ended,
he rubbed his forehead repeatedly with his
hand, and seemed a prey to some hopeless
perplexity.


\"So that if the property is not piu-chased
within a given time," he began, " there
might result a positive inconvenience,—-a
kind of obstacle,—to the establishment of
Mademoiselle Felicie."


\"A kind of obstacle !" echoed the
Vicomte; " why, it would be ruin, my
dear Monsieur,—ruin to us all; for such
a parti as Monsieur de Champmorin is not
to be found readily in the provinces."


Monsieur de Verancour, like a great
many people in his position, became
pressing the moment he had ceased to be
superciUous and disdainful, and he was on the
verge of becoming importunate. Now that
<!-- Leaf 175, Page: 157 -->
he had been forced into confiding in
Monsieur Richard, it did seem to him so
tremendous a fact that a daughter of the
house of Verancour should be placed in a
dilemma out of which this low-born,
moneylending bourgeois could extricate her, that
he thought by the mere statement of the
case to overwhelm that individual and
secure his services to an unhmited extent.


When the Vicomte made the hurried and
vehement admission of his embarrassment,
a flush stole over Monsieur Richard's cheek,
and a Ught shot from beneath his eyelids;
but he concealed both by his hand, on which
he leant.


\"I could hardly have believed," he said,
slowly, and with an expression of sorrow,
\"that any event, coming immediately after
the dreadful catastrophe which has so
<!-- Leaf 176, Page: 158 -->
shaken me, could give me such intense
pain; but indeed, Monsieur le Vicomte,
your statement makes me miserable beyond
words. Do you require me to say that my
devotion to your famdy is without bounds ?
Obscure as I am, I may be allowed to
express my gratitude. Your kindness to
me since my misfortune has made me your
slave. I would give my life to serve any
of you." The Vicomte looked benignly
upon his inferior, and seemed to accept
his sacrifice with indulgence. " But,"
continued Richard Prevost, "it is out of
my power to do anything."


"How out of your power?" retorted the
Vicomte, forgetful of everything save his
own needs. " Surely you can keep your
uncle's engagement?"  
  
  
  " Perhaps at some later date," replied
<!-- Leaf 177, Page: 159 -->
Monsieur Richard. " It would pain me too
much to say no !—perhaps later;—perhaps
when I see clear in my own affairs. You
see times are bad just now;—the financial
crisis lasts stdl, and I cannot sell. All the
ready money has been carried away, as you
know, by the robbery; and I am myself
in difficulties, for I am concluding the
arrangements for the purchase of the
Chateaubrevdle estate; and,—to you I will
avow it,—I do not know how to obtain
what is wanted for the first payment,
because, as I said before, all securities are
so depreciated, that if I sell, I must be a
heavy loser. However, later; in a month
or two "


"Good God!" exclaimed the Vicomte,
rudely, "in a month or two all will be
over ! Unless I can get the money within
<!-- Leaf 178, Page: 160 -->
a fortnight Champmorin will be off! His
notary is a sharp fellow, and wdl soon find
out how the land really Hes. And once
this chance gone, where is Felicie to find
a husband ? I wish you would tell me!"


"Oh! Monsieur le Vicomte!" answered
Richard, bowing low, "it is not for such
as me to point out that;—but assuredly
so accompUshed a young lady, so admirable
a person as Mademoiselle Felicie, and of so
illustrious a race, can only have to choose."


\"Bah ! " retorted Monsieur de
Verancour; "no perfections are worth a centime !
And in the pit of ignominy into which we
have sunk, gold only is powerful. The
noblesse deserts itself, the historical names
seU themselves to the highest bidders, and
take the mothers of their future sons from
the gutter, so there be money to be got!
<!-- Leaf 179, Page: 161 -->
I teU you Felicie has no chance. She
must Uve to be a beggarly old maid, if
she can't marry Champmorin !" And then
Monsieur le Vicomte fell to wheedling
his opponent, and called him his " dear
Monsieur Richard," and expressed his
conviction that he would help him out of his
difficulties in consideration of the friendship
they bore him.


When Monsieur de Verancour took leave
of Richard Prevost the latter had promised
to try and borrow the seventy thousand
francs, but he laid stress on the word " try,"
for he said the operation would be difficult.


The Vicomte was no sooner gone than
Monsieur Richard opened a drawer in the
table near which he was sitting, and drew out
a large leather portfolio fuU of papers. After
turning over several of them, he stopped  
  
  
  VOL. I. M
<!-- Leaf 180, Page: 162 -->
at one, and looked at it a long while.
It was the deed of sale of Les Grandes
Bruyeres, drawn up by old Martin Prevost.


Monsieur Richard spelt and weighed
every word, and then at last took it up
and examined it closely. In so doing
another sheet of paper adhered to it, and
from between the folds a half-open letter
dropped upon the ground. When Richard
Prevost had sufficiently examined the deed,
he replaced it in the portfolio, then stooped,
picked up the faUen letter, and was about to
replace it too; but something in it arrested
his attention, and he opened and read it; it
was as follows :—  
  
  
  " My Dear Monsieur Prevost,

\"I dare not go to you, for fear my
father should hear of it and have some
<!-- Leaf 181, Page: 163 -->
suspicion, and my father must not know of
what I am about to ask. You once told me,
when I was only a boy, that if I ever
needed help I must apply to you. I do so
now. I am in absolute need of the sum of
two thousand francs. I have no means of
getting it,—and if I do not get it, I no
longer care for hfe ! My future, my
happiness, everything hangs upon this, to you, so
trifling a sum, and a week hence will be too
late ! Do not let me ask in vain. I have
believed in your words, I have rehed upon
you, I have no other resource. For the sake
of the gratitude they say your mother once
owed to mine, help me now.  
  
  
  " Yours devotedly,  
  
  
  " Raoul de Morville."  
  
  
  Richard grew pale and red alternately, as
<!-- Leaf 182, Page: 164 -->
he read and re-read this letter, and when
he saw the date, the 7th of October, he
muttered to himself, " Just a week before
the day ! Oh ! my God, my God ! what is
this ! " and crumpling the letter up in one
of his hands, he sank back upon his chair,
and leaned his head upon the table before
him.
<!-- Leaf 183 -->
  
  CHAPTER VIII.  
  
  
  LESS THAN A SQUIRE.

The MorvUles belonged to a class more
numerous in the west than in any other
part of France;—to the class known under
the denomination of gentillatres de
campagne. Before the Revolution these people
had their use, for from them the lesser
Princes of the Blood, such as Messieurs de
Conde and Conti, for instance, ancl the
Great Vassals, such as Messieurs de
Montmorency, Rohan, and others of that stamp,
took the more active part of their
<!-- Leaf 184, Page: 166 -->
households; and their adventurous spirit, mixed
with the daring of the "cadets de famille,"
helped, from the battles of the Ligue to
those of La Vendee, to give to the armies
of France their reputation for recklessness
and dash, and to keep up the prestige of
"la furia francese," acquired during the
Italian invasions of Charles of Anjou.


So far, then, the pre-revolutionary
existence of these small landholders has a
motive. But after '89 ! After '89 it would
be hard to find any reason why they should
continue to be; yet there they are as
distinct as ever from the classes both above
and below them; and having in good
earnest " neither learnt nor forgotten"
anything, they can scarcely be described
otherwise than as a nuisance.  
  
  
  What remains of the historical nobility
<!-- Leaf 185, Page: 167 -->
of France has,—so long as all remembrance
of, or reference to history has not been
wiped out,—a kind of signification. While
a Court and a Government subsist, which
require great dignitaries, enormously paid
functionaries, men whose business it is to
represent the splendour of the country,—
diplomatists, for instance, whose duty it
still is to communicate with foreign Courts
after the fashion kept up in those Courts,—
whUe all this yet subsists, the ancient
names of France have an obvious raison
d'etre. Besides, in some cases they serve
to perpetuate the traditions of elegance,
refinement, good-breeding, and really
gentlemanly feeling, for which France was
once famous. But to what use can possibly
be put the families of men who assert that
their social position,—that is, their name,'—
<!-- Leaf 186, Page: 168 -->
prevents them from gaining money in
commerce or trade, and the extreme smallness
of whose means deprives them of even the
ordinary education of the middle-class in
any other country at the present day ? Too
poor to Uve on a footing of equality with
those whom they call their equals, too
proud to associate with those whom they
call "low-born,"—and who despise them,—
too idle to learn, and too proud to work, they
Uve on in their uncomfortable homes, and
on their narrow resources, virtually cut
off from all communication with the great
cm-rents of activity or thought, and are,
perhaps, in all Europe, the most thoroughly
useless class that can be imagined,—the
completest representatives of all that was
worst in the Ancien Regime.  
  
  
  Early in this century there lived, at about
<!-- Leaf 187, Page: 169 -->
a league's distance from D, at a small,
tumble-down kind of farm caUed La
MorvUliere, two brothers, one named Rene, the
other Charles, de MorviUe. The elder stuck
to his " dirty acres," married,- had two
chUdren,—a girl, who died, and Raoul,
whom we have already seen, and who was
now twenty-two. The younger, Charles,
ran away from home at seventeen, was
sought for in vain for several years, had
made a sador of himself, and achieved glory,
by dint of hard service, and harder knocks.
He was now an admiral, and had recently
gained fresh distinction in China.


Although a vast distance lay, in the mind
of the Vicomte, between the " Chateau "
and this wretched little lairdship of La
Morvilliere, and although the " fils des
croises " looked loftdy down upon persons
<!-- Leaf 188, Page: 170 -->
whose ancestors had certainly never been
more than squires to crusaders or
crusaders' sons, even if they had been that,
still, old Morville was a capital shot, not
an unpleasant companion, and in the
thinlypeopled neighbourhood of D he was
better than nothing. At aU events, he was
not a bourgeois ! He was not a lawyer or
a banker, or an employe, or a savant. He
knew nothing, and did nothing! There
was always that to say in his favour. So
Monsieur le Vicomte consorted with him.
The two wives, who were now both dead,
became very dear friends, and the two
Demoiselles de Verancour went to the same
convent, at Poitiers, with Marie de MorviUe,
for whose schooling at that venerable
institution her parents contrived to find just
money enough to pay. The girl was
<!-- Leaf 189, Page: 171 -->
delicate, required good hving and exercise, and
the bad hving and seclusion of the convent
killed her. She went out like a lamp, and
as no one around her could understand
why, she was, on the whole, rather blamed
than pitied.  
  
  
  Her mother mourned in sUence over her

loss, and, at the end of a couple of years,
died also. Died, not only of grieving, but
because in the dull, weakening monotony
of an existence carried on under suchconditions as those of the Morville family,
there are no reserve-forces created. Life

is never replenished, and when the
particular sources of vitahty of one epoch have
been drained, there is no general fountain
of life from which to borrow the vitality
required for a fresh period. There is no
transformation of strength, and men and
<!-- Leaf 190, Page: 172 -->
women, — but, above all, women, — die
simply because they have not life enough
left in them wherewith to go on living.
The clock goes down, and stops.


Madame de Morville and her friend, the
Vicomtesse, were no more,—it is the fittest
expression for the act of their departing this
life,—within a year of each other, and the
void left at La Morvilliere was never to be
filled up. The wife had been, what she so
frequently is in France, the pivot upon
which everything and everybody turns. In
characterising her emphatically as " wife,"
I am, perhaps, wrong. One ought rather to
say the housekeeper, for that is in reality
her function. She rules supreme, and makes
it possible, no matter how straitened are the
ways and means, for the famUy to exist
without getting into debt, and without
<!-- Leaf 191, Page: 173 -->
having their embarrassments dragged before
the public.


When the mistress of the house was gone,
the house at La MorviUiere went to wrack
and ruin. Old Morville was utterly
incapable of either putting or keeping order
anywhere, and he flew into perpetual fits of
fury at the ever-recurring evidences of
disorder. He did not complain of being
obhged to Uve chiefly on cabbage soup, but
he stormed at the fact of the cabbage soup
being rarely eatable. The pigs were so
illfed that there was no fat to the bacon, and
the historical food of Frenchmen in or about
La Vendee came up to table little more than
a vast bowlful of greenish water and
yellowish grease. In the shooting season there
was game, it is true, but old Morville, at
sixty, was not so active as he used to be;
<!-- Leaf 192, Page: 174 -->
for the house was terribly damp, and he
could not afford to warm it, neither could
he afford good wine to light up the fires in
his own bodily system; and so he grew
rheumatic and morose. There was no

money to pay for anything, and the D 
tradespeople were eternally clamouring for
the payment of their small bills. It was a
wretched state of existence, and most
wretched did old Morville find it.


As to Raoul, the real misery, however,
was for him, who had never yet complained.
He attained the age oftwenty-two, with
comparatively no education at all. But
here Nature compensated for all deficiencies.
The boy's energies were so rare, his
intelligence was so bright, his desire to acquire
knowledge so steady and strong, that he
managed to scrape together an amount of
<!-- Leaf 193, Page: 175 -->
information which put him on a par with
the other young men about him, whilst the
difficulty with which he had acquired it
made him infinitely their superior.


The Cure of D had taken a deep
interest in Raoul from the boy's earliest
ehddhood, and the Cure of D was a
remarkable man,—remarkable for his profane,
as well as theological, learning, for his
Uberal opinions, and for the uprightness of
his character. He taught Raoul all he could
teach him,—Latin, history, grammar, and
the elements of geometry, and gave him the
run of his library, which was an extensive
one.


Raoul had had another patron,—a very
singular one; and this was no other than
Martin Prevost, who had an inexplicable
fondness for the lad, and was reported to
<!-- Leaf 194, Page: 176 -->
have said that if old Morville would or
could do nothing for his son, he would help
him whenever he required help.


The tradition in and about D was,
that Madame de Morville had once rendered
a great service to old Prevost's mother,
when Madame de Morville herself was a
young married woman, and Madame Prevost
an aged one, within two years of her death.
Monsieur le Cure knew all about it, and it
was supposed that Martin Prevost did so
too. At all events, his liking for Raoul was
a fact. Old Morville, so far from feeling
kindly towards Martin Prevost, held his
inclination for the boy to be a positive piece
of presumption, and formally forbade his
son ever to associate with Richard Prevost.
Admiral de MorviUe, who was a sensible,
practical man, and had rubbed off the crust
<!-- Leaf 195, Page: 177 -->
of provincial prejudice, if it ever adhered to
him, in his rough contact with the world,
did his utmost whenever he came to La
Morvilhere to atone for his brother's
susceptibilities and stupid mistakes, and he
never failed to call upon Martin Prevost
once or twice during his stay in the
neighbourhood, and invariably took his nephew
with him on these occasions.


But since the return of the two sisters
from their convent at Poitiers, the one
attraction for Raoul de Morville in D 
was the Chateau. The pretext was a ready
one. Raoul had been devotedly attached to
his dead sister. There was but one year
between the two, and he was sixteen when
Marie died. He himself was wont to say he
should never be consoled for her loss, and
that it had been a heavier blow to him even  
  
  
  VOL. I. N
<!-- Leaf 196, Page: 178 -->
than the death of his mother. Felicie de
Verancour was reputed to have been Marie
de Morville's chosen friend, though Marie
herself had seemed to have a yearning love
towards little Vevette, who was but a child,.
and called the elder schoolfellow invariably
her " petite maman."


How it all came about, who shall say ?
And, first, what was it ? Raoul and Vevette
glided into a perfect unity of heart and soul,
into an identity of being, as a boat on an
unknown river glides down into a whirlpool,
without knowing it. They knew only of
theu- happiness; they did not know of their
love, till the fact stood revealed to them
that theh- love was misery. Then it was too
late.


No one in the Verancour household had
heeded Raoul. He had not a sou !—he was
<!-- Leaf 197, Page: 179 -->
sans consequence. Not quite so completely
sans consequence as Monsieur Richard,
because Raoul was a gentleman, after all, but
he was "beyond the pale" because of his
poverty. His remarkable good looks, his
winning ways, his intelligence, his fiery
energy,—all went for nothing. It was
totaUy impossible a "man without a sou"
should be dangerous to a "well-born
woman," and so no one ever adverted to the
possible danger of Raoul for Vevette. As
to old MorviUe, he never thought of his son
at all, till his brother the Admiral came
down to La Morvilliere one day, and
signified that "something" must be done for
Raoul.


"Something! but what?" grumbled the
father.  
  
  
  " I will take care of that," replied the
<!-- Leaf 198, Page: 180 -->
Admiral, and then propounded the famous
scheme for the clerkship in the Admiralty.


This happened about the end of
September, and at first there seemed small
chance of the Admiral's project ever coming
to maturity. Not only did old MorvUle
object to his son becoming an employe, but
Raoul himself respectfully, but firmly,
refused to consent until he should have
reflected amply upon the obligations of the
career opened to him. Old Morville was a
fool, and his brother was neither astonished
at, nor did he care much for, his refusal; but
Raoul,—what made him hesitate ? That
the Admiral could not fathom, and, after all,
as his nephew only asked for time, he gave
it him, and waited. In the first days of
October the Admiral returned to Paris, and
it was settled that Raoul should write to
<!-- Leaf 199, Page: 181 -->
him when he had made up his mind, and
that he should have till the end of the

month to do so.


The one thing to which Raoul de
MorvUle did make up his mind was, that
Vevette should one day be his wife. But
what were the means by which to achieve
this end?

The great evd of that in France which is

lonely than he who seeks sohtude in the

but there is no poetry in a pond, and no life
in a canal, for neither has any depths to be
stirred. What is non-Parisian in France is
not rural or agricultural, it is narrowly
provincial. On a narrow, shallow scale, an
imitation is sought to be produced of a
gigantic model, and, Uke all imitations, it is
a failure. It is truly as a pond to a sea, and
as no real ground-swells move it, and as no
real storm-winds lash it, it is, as a pond,
lifeless, and it stagnates. Nothing but
disease is to be gained by living always on
the banks of a pond, and thus it is that the
true provincial in France breathes only the
odours of stagnation, or if he mistakes for
life and activity his own attempts to ruffle
the waters, he merely succeeds in stirring
up mud.
<!-- Leaf 202, Page: 184 -->

It is a dreary and unwholesome existence
this of small provincial towns in France.
Devoid of all that elevates, it detaches man
from himself;—flinging him, as it were,
away into some vast interest or cause,
and pinning him down to all his lower
wants and instincts, paralysing his mind,
drying up his heart; and,—far from
guarding him from vice,—only making vice
itself worse by making it more matter of
fact.


If the little town of D had had all
its houses unroofed, and their secrets laid
bare by a " diable boiteux," you would
have shuddered to find how much more
degraded the human species was there than in
the larger centre of the capital itself; for
you would have found all the levels much
lower, and all the sins of sensuality and
<!-- Leaf 203, Page: 185 -->
greed utterly unbalanced by any generous
instincts or lofty aspirations.


As the collective efforts of the population
of D tended persistently towards the
fashioning of that small place upon the
approved plan of a Grande Ville, you would,
had you lived there, have found a miniature
copy of all the faults and absurdities of
bigger cities.


There were people who did not visit
other people, but who, all the same, kept a
close watch over the proceedings of those
other persons whom they could not visit!
There was intrigue and hypocrisy and
dishonesty and cunning enough to furnish the
amount desired by the most despotic Court
or Government in Europe a hundred years
ago; a perpetual craving for " place,"
though there was no place higher than
<!-- Leaf 204, Page: 186 -->
the dignity of Maire or Conseiller
Municipal;—and a considerable sprinkling of
adultery.


D, in this its transition state of
progress towards the morals and manners of a
great town, had its " lion,"—a real
indigenous lion, or, as the French term it, a
\"coq de village." This was no other than
a certain Monsieur Duprez, a man of some
six or seven-and-thirty, whose father had,
twenty years before, been the medical
practitioner of the place, and who was, by the
public voice of D, declared to have
\"made his fortune." Monsieur Duprez was
what ladies'-maids term a wonderfully fine
man. He had bushy whiskers and red lips,
curly hair and a white forehead, and there
was about him a certain air of ease and good
nature and jollity which drew towards him
<!-- Leaf 205, Page: 187 -->
many who, " de parti pris," had decided to
keep aloof from him. The deceased doctor
had left his son a goodly house in the
principal street of D, and, instead of selling
it, the said son jauntily opined that he was
rich enough to keep it, and that it was
pleasant to have a home in the spot where
he was bom, and where, as he was
graciously pleased to observe, he loved every
one and every one loved him. And so
Monsieur Leon used to come often to his

paternal mansion, and stay there for a few
weeks at a time, and it was rumoured that
a strong attraction was exercised over him
by the wife of the Juge de Paix. This
lady, though his senior, and now past forty,
was stiU undeniably handsome, and people
asserted that he could not loosen the chain
with which she had bound him. However,
<!-- Leaf 206, Page: 188 -->
be that as it may, Monsieur Duprez came
very often to D, sent down showy
articles of furniture from Paris, gave dinners
now and then to the " authorities ! " played
billiards with the whole town, beating
everybody, and at the cafe on the Market
Place, opposite the Mairie, was the life and
soul of the daily gatherings, and initiated
all D into the deepest mysteries of
politics and finance throughout Europe.
What had set the crown to this gentleman's
popularity was, that, about a year before the
period we are speaking of, he had sent a
tolerable-looking horse, ancl what he styled
a Tilbury, down to his house, and when he
was present he drove himself out in this
vehicle, and when he was absent he lent it
to the Juge de Paix, who drove out his
wife. This the people of D called an
<!-- Leaf 207, Page: 189 -->
equipage, and the position of Monsieur Leon
became a sohd one.


One man alone would never consent to
have anything to do with Monsieur Dupisez,
and that man was old Martin Prevost. He
resisted all that amiable person's repeated
attempts to captivate him, and when any
of their neighbours affirmed that Monsieur
Leon had made his fortune, and was a rich
man, he invariably answered, " That is
what we shall see some day."


Unfortunately, in the life of such small
towns as D the attraction hardly ever
eluded is the cafe. Business and idleness
lead to it alike. Either it is the natural
place of appointment for those who have
affairs on hand, or it is the natural place
for those to lounge in who have no
employment for their hours. And so, from the
<!-- Leaf 208, Page: 190 -->
notaiy or avoue clown to the labourer, and
from the petty tradesman up to the
neighbouring squire, you are pretty certain to
see, the entire male population of a small
town and its environs send its members
successively to the cafe,—above all, if there
be but one.


Martin Prevost and his nephew, though
so dissimilar in all their ways, were alike
in this, that neither ever set foot in the
cafe; and that was what could be said of
no other individual in D


{empty}M. de Verancour, on the other hand,
would occasionally stroll in, and gratify
himself with a "demi-tasse," or it might
be a " choppe," according to the season
or the time of the day at which his visit
was paid. Within the last twelvemonths
Raoul de Morville had taken to frequenting
<!-- Leaf 209, Page: 191 -->
the cafe regularly; and, above all, when
Monsieur Duprez was at D he would
pass hour after hour playing billiards, or
talking with " Monsieur Leon," as he was
familiarly called.


Raoul's age, disposition, and peculiar
circumstances, all combined to make him
the easy dupe of a man like Duprez.
Public opinion,—and no matter how small
the field, a few hundred men soon constitute
a public, and force those who live with
them to accept the fact,—public opinion
proclaimed Monsieur Leon successful. Here
was his power over Raoul. Success was
necessarily young Morville's idol, for to
succeed was to win Vevette.


But succeed in what ? What was the
particular career in which Raoul wished
to succeed, or for which he was fitted ?
<!-- Leaf 210, Page: 192 -->
That point remained vague and
undetermined in his mind, but Monsieur Leon and
his " success " fascinated him. Now, those
two words " reussir" and " parvenu-,"
which have within the last fifteen years
in France risen to such a terrible
importance, and which, be it observed, never are
associated with any distinct object,—it is
never said in what a man has succeeded,
or to what he is parvenu,—those two
words simply mean the sudden
acquirement of wealth by a lucky chance. They
imply neither genius, toil, nor patience;
they merely imply that, by some piece of
good luck, the individual in question has
acquired wealth before he was too old to
enjoy it. They make the successful man
interesting, because fate is supposed to have
decided in his favour.
<!-- Leaf 211, Page: 193 -->

Day after day then Raoul thought more
highly of Monsieur Duprez, and set all his
energies to discovering how he, too, could
compel fortune without loss of time. It
was not that he disliked work, but that
he was impatient; he would have toiled
night and day for his end, but he longed
for Vevette. And so he came to question
his new friend about his Golden Fleece
expeditions, and Monsieur Duprez smiled
and said nothing was so easy, and that
really if men were not wealthy now-a-days
it was that they did not care to be so.
And then he invariably wound up his
speech with, "Look at me; when I went
to Paris ten years ago, I had but a thousand
francs in my pocket. I could not sell the
house here, therefore it was a dead weight.
I had one thousand francs ready money,—  
  
  
  VOL. I. o
<!-- Leaf 212, Page: 194 -->
and look at me now !" And at these words
Monsieur Leon was wont to indulge in a
look and gesture that seemed to say he
could buy aU D if he chose: barring
old Prevost, that was the interpretation all
D gave to the words.


Ten years! yes; but ten years was
an eternity. Raoul could not wait ten
years. Why, he should be thirty-two and
Vevette twenty-seven. " Ten years, what
an age!"


"Money is made quicker now," would
reply Monsieur Leon. "With ten
thousand francs in hand a man who* knows
what he is about may make a hundred
thousand in six months and a milUon in
a year."


What Aladdin's lamp-like visions ! But
where on earth were the ten thousand
<!-- Leaf 213, Page: 195 -->
francs to be got that were to be the key
to them all ?


By dint of listening to Monsieur Leon,
however, young Morville's head got filled
with ideas of the possibilities of riches; and
one day, about the middle of September,
Monsieur Leon imparted to his eager
disciple his plans for the working of a silver
mine in Mexico, and proved, to the latter's
entire satisfaction, that the man who should
invest two thousand francs, no more, in
that incomparable scheme, would inevitably
realise fifty per cent, upon his venture;
for under the seal of absolute secrecy,
Monsieur Leon mentioned the names of
great chiefs upon the Bourse who were
resolved to drive up the shares to fabulous
premiums the moment the prospectus of
the company appeared. Then, too, there
<!-- Leaf 214, Page: 196 -->
was no saying what the future might not
bring forth,—a young, active, energetic
man would be required to undertake the
journey to Mexico, and report on the
progress of the works. It might be a journey
of some danger, but the remuneration
would be princely, and on his return home
what might not the successful emissary
aspire to!


\"Only," Monsieur Duprez would
prudently add, "the repute of the enterprise
is so high amongst the few who know of it
that it would be probably impossible to
secure twenty shares now."


Monsieur Leon, however, had taken a
sincere liking for Raoul. The young
fellow's intelligence and ardour pleased him;
he dehghted in his ambition, and would go
all lengths to serve him.
<!-- Leaf 215, Page: 197 -->

"But, my dear friend," objected he one
day, " what is the use of talking in this
way of shares, and silver mines, and
premiums, and Mexican companies ? Where,
in the name of Heaven, could you get two
thousand francs ? Supposing that by any
effort I could get you the twenty shares,
could you by any witchcraft get the
money ? "


"Who knows?" had been Raoul's reply.
"Perhaps I might find means."


This was just the period when Admiral
de Morville having proposed the clerkship
in the Marine Ministry to his nephew,
consented to give the latter time to consider
whether he accepted or not.


In the first days of October Monsieur
Duprez's importance rose immensely in the
public mind of D, for he was
<!-- Leaf 216, Page: 198 -->
observed to receive telegrams incessantly,
sometimes two in the same day. D 
was not a telegraph station, and a man on
horseback had to bring the despatches from
Cholet, an hour's ride, and his arrival was
an event, and shed glory over the receiver
of the missives, who was forthwith elevated
to the rank of a Mires or a Pereire.


On the 6th of the month, Monsieur Leon
announced to Raoul that he could secure
the shares, and that he might have one
week wherein to find the money. "But,"
added he, "after the fifteenth it will be too
late; for on the afternoon of that day I
must start for Paris to undertake the
settlement of various preliminary details with
my friends."


Had Raoul de Morville in all his
surroundings any one who cared to note the
<!-- Leaf 217, Page: 199 -->
changes in his humour or his countenance,
they might have marked his visible anxiety
during that week. But there were none
who thus cared, and during those few days
he never went near the Chateau.


On the afternoon of the 14th of October
Raoul called on Monsieur Duprez, and
deposited in his hands two bank-notes of one
thousand francs each. And his financial
patron slapped him on the shoulder, and
said his fortune was made.


Monsieur Leon left for Paris the next
day, convinced in his own mind that the
money came to Raoul from his uncle, for
on that same morning the postman had
carried to La MorviUiere a registered letter
with the Paris postmark. These little
details are pubhc property in places like
D, and the successful parvenu had
<!-- Leaf 218, Page: 200 -->
  
  made up his mind as to what was in that
registered letter.  
  
  
  
\"Goes halves with the nephew in his
prospects of gain," muttered he to himself.
\"Vieux loup de mer, va !"
<!-- Leaf 219 -->
  
  CHAPTER X.  
  
  
  THE FEAST FOR THE DEAD.

I have already said that the Cure of D 
was a remarkable man. His great
superiority lay in that he was so upright in
mind and so largely, unmistakably human.
The great fault of all ecclesiastics, whether
belonging to the Church of Rome or to
other confessions, is that they confine
themselves narrowly within their establishments,
and ceasing to be men, become churchmen.
This was precisely what the Cure of D   
  
  
  did not do. He was a man among his
<!-- Leaf 220, Page: 202 -->
fellow-men, feeling for them and with them,
and never preaching at, or condemning, or
denouncing and renouncing them, but
simply striving to understand them. Neither,
strong in his own faith as he was, did he
ever take upon himself to help the Almighty
in his work of awakening faith in others,
but waited till God's grace touched them;
waited prayerfully and trustfully, but could
not be brought to recognise the duty of
knocking ancl driving faith into people by
sledge-hammer threats of damnation.


The Cure of D had nothing about
him of the conventional Apostolic type.
Nobody among his parishioners, neither the
old women nor the very young ones, ever
called him either an angel or a saint, but
every one respected him, and all were ready
to declare that he was the most thoroughly
<!-- Leaf 221, Page: 203 -->
honest man that ever breathed. He was
ugly and awkward, being large jointed,
stout, and ungainly in his movements, and
having a big round head, with a large flat
face. Yet the kind, truthful expression of
his ox-like grey eyes invited confidence and
inspired courage. Downhearted people
always went to him and came away cheered.
He was of a singularly undaunted nature,
loved aU men, and feared nothing. When
a misfortune happened to an unbeliever he
was by that unbeliever's side an hour after,
giving him the practical help he needed,
and invariably saying that good Christians
wanted him far less than bad ones. It
was notorious that when Pere Vincent's
cow died, and left him ruined, Monsieur
le Cure gave him the means of buying
another out of his own purse; and as Pere
<!-- Leaf 222, Page: 204 -->
Vincent was an infidel and a scoffer and the
son of a father who had in '93 massacred
priests, this fact scandalised the bishops;
but it caused Pere Vincent to have himself
baptised within the year, and to bow his
head meekly before the gentle force of the
Gospel. It was also notorious that in June,
'48, when Monsieur le Maire, terrified
almost into insanity, was nowhere to be
found, the Cure had assumed his place,
and distributing cartouches to the Garde
Nationale and sturdy counsel to each
individual man, had organised and kept up
such a respectable system of defence for
the Uttle town of D, that the various
insurrectionary bands that swept through
the department agreed to leave D
unvisited, and avowed later that they were
afraid of the Cure.
<!-- Leaf 223, Page: 205 -->

Well! it is true; that was a thing often
said of om- friend. Many people pretended
they were afraid of him; but those who did
so were always found to be half-and-half
natures, faint souls, who quailed less before
darkness than before hght.


Between old Prevost and the Cure there
had been a sort of tacit compromise,
somewhat after the fashion of that which exists
in France between the Church and the
State; each, at bottom, regarding the other
as a necessary evd. The Cure couldn't, for
the Use of him, esteem Martin Prevost, for he
was far too sure of the latter's usm-ious
exactions; and his charity and his honesty had
bouts of hard fighting with each other over
the grandson of the Swiss valet de chambre;
—for, let it be avowed, the Cure was, of
the two, more honest even than charitable.
<!-- Leaf 224, Page: 206 -->

This it was which made Martin Prevost
respect him. A Voltairian himself, if he
had had to do with a priest who was only
a priest, let what might have been his
virtues, he would have got the better of
him, and made his life intolerable in D;
but the Cure met him on his own ground,
and, if they had tried conclusions, would^have
beaten him on it, and this Martin Prevost
felt, and avoided all collision with him. If
the Cure stated that money must be given
for some practical purpose, old Prevost
gave his share without murmuring, and
what was more, Madame Jean contributed
hers too; for the Cure never went about
begging, ancl never got up "quetes" for
sentimental objects.


When Martin Prevost came to his violent
end, the Cure was, as he invariably proved
<!-- Leaf 225, Page: 207 -->
to be upon all emergencies, the most useful
person in D He inspired the Maire
with courage, and the Juge de Paix with
good sense, and persuaded the Juge
d'Instruction, who was sent from the chef-lieu
du departement, to refrain from committing
daily acts of arbitrary folly. If it had not
been for the Cure the whole town would
have been preventively imprisoned, and at
the same time, if it had not been for him,
the scanty traces of the direction taken by
the murderer would not have been
discovered. To Monsieur Richard the Cure
had shown every imaginable kindness, going
even the length of offering him a room at
the Presbytere, if the residence in his
crime-polluted, blood-stained home proved
too much for him.  
  
  
  " C'est un fier homme que Monsieur le
<!-- Leaf 226, Page: 208 -->
Cure ?"—so proclaimed Madame Jean, who
in no way partook of her defunct master's
Voltairianism; preferring, however, for her
own spiritual needs, the mild humdrum,
gossiping, guidance of the Vicaire to the
rough-handed thorough direction of his
superior.


All Saints' Day had come and was past,
and a finer first of November had rarely been
witnessed. The sun was bright and warm,
and the sky blue as in May, and all D 

had been present at High Mass, and all the
womankind of D had attended vespers.


The church clock struck six, night was
beginning to close in, and the vigils for the
feast of the dead, the solemn fete of the next
day, were ended. The Cure gave a last look
round the sacristy to see that all was in
order; he had already allowed the Vicaire
<!-- Leaf 227, Page: 209 -->
and the sacristan to go to then- respective
homes; and then taking in hand an
enormous key which hung with three or four
others to a ponderous iron ring, he prepared
to put it into the lock of the so-called
choirdoor, and lock from the outside the entrance
which was opposite to the Presbytere. Just
as the key grated in the ward he heard a
voice speaking to him. " Don't shut me up,
please," said the sweet, girlish voice, and a
slight form, clothed in black, brushed past
the Cure and crossed the threshold.


"You, my chdd?" exclaimed he on
recognising Vevette. "Why, I didn't see
you in church. I thought you had gone to
St. Philibert."


\"No; I did not; Felicie did. You know
I always come here." These last words
were said in a subdued tone and contained  
  
  
  VOL. I. P
<!-- Leaf 228, Page: 210 -->
an allusion to what was rather a sore point
between the Cure and the Chateau.


In former days the Chateau had had two
parishes; the upper or eastern parts of the
estate lying within the jurisdiction of the
ecclesiastical authorities of D, while the
lands to the west belonged to the parish of
St. Philibert. The Canon Law of France
prescribing that High Mass on Sundays
and feast days shall be attended by every
parishioner at the church of his parish, the
Verancour family had seemingly no choice
now save to go into the town for the
exercise of thefr religious duties; but the little
hamlet of St. Philibert had attractions
solMademoiselle Felicie, and she maintained
that she had still a right to regard herself
as a parishioner of St. Philibert, and at aU
events to take the Cure of St. Philibert for
<!-- Leaf 229, Page: 211 -->
her confessor. Accordingly, the compromise
hit upon tacitly by both parties was, that
if the inmates of the Chateau attended all
great ceremonies at the town church, they
were free to attend aU lesser ones at the
church, or chapel rather, of the village.
Now vespers and vigils are not strictly
obligatory, and mass being over, Mademoiselle
Felicie had resorted for the afternoon
services to the place of worship most agreeable
to her, leaving her sister, as was her wont,
to hear every note of " les offices " at the
church at D


"It is late for you to be out alone, my
child," said the Cure, as he turned the
heavy key in the rusty lock of the door.


\"I am not alone," answered Vevette.
\"Mere Jubine's Louison is with me," and
she pointed to the tall figure of a girl who
<!-- Leaf 230, Page: 212 -->
was standing at a few yards from them, close
to the trunk of a sycamore.


By the dim rays of the lantern that he
carried in his hand you could see an
expression of displeasure pass over the rugged
features of the Cure. " She is not a fitting
person to accompany you," observed he in a
loud whisper.


\"Oh! Monsieur le Cure," rejoined
Vevette, half reproachfuUy, " you must not
be hard upon her; she is really a very good
girl; and, besides, if she had not promised
to come back with me, I could not have
come at all."


"No! of course not," retorted he, "so
long as Mademoiselle Felicie indulges in
particular fancies for this or that chapel, or
this or that minister of God."  
  
  
  " Ah! Monsieur le Cure," interrupted
<!-- Leaf 231, Page: 213 -->
Vevette, "now you are hard upon
Felicie."


\"I hope I am not hard upon any one,"
said the Cure; " but I am anxious to see
the worship of the Almighty kept pure from
all unworthy personal considerations; and,
for instance, my child, I do hope that if
death,—or the Bishop,—should remove me
from D, you will be to my successor, as
your parish priest, all you have been to me,
even should he happen to be the reverse of
whatever you may choose to think pleasant
or agreeable. Where are we tending ? " he
added, after a moment's pause, and walking
on a step or two, " with all these littlenesses,
and caprices, and hypocrisies ? The love of
God and the fear of God are disappearing
from human hearts, ancl in their place we
have new-fangled practices, pet-prayers, and
<!-- Leaf 232, Page: 214 -->
medals ! Medals ! " he repeated in a
singular tone of deprecation. " Forms ! forms !
imitation piety ! "


Vevette smiled, and said with a touch of
raillery in her sweet voice, "Well! what
you say is always the exact reverse of
what the Abbe Leroy says." The Cure of
St. PhUibert usually went by his own name,
whilst the parish priest of D was  
  
  
  was

emphatically " Monsieur le Cure" for ten
miles round. " The Abbe Leroy insists
upon it that we can never bind ourselves
down by too many forms."


\"The Abbe Leroy is a Jesuit," broke in
the Cure, abruptly. " They don't know
where they are leading the Church, nor how
they are falsifying her teachings. However,
faith and prayer are our only arms;—and
hard work," he added; " the incessant labour
<!-- Leaf 233, Page: 215 -->
to bring all our brethren to see the truth,
and love it. My poor little lamb !. don't let
yourself be be-medalled. Love God, and
strive beyond your strength to act
uprightly and honestly; to do what is right.
All the medals in the world won't help you
as much as that will."


Thus saying, they reached the
threshold of the Presbytere, the door of which
was opened by a stern-featured woman,
long past the canonic age,* and familiar to
D as "Monsieur le Cure's Lise."


\"I've been drawn into preaching,"
observed the Cure, with a shake of the
head; "a dangerous habit!—leads to
intolerance, and to judging one's neighbours.
Here, dear child, take this box ofdra
* No priest is allowed in France to be served by a
woman under forty.
<!-- Leaf 234, Page: 216 -->
gees; * they come from the christening of
this morning;—Pierre Campion's little girl,
you know; "—and he tendered to Vevette a
round box which he extracted from the deep
pockets of his wide soutane.


"Nay," objected Vevette, "not all,—give
me half."


\"Give the other half to Mademoiselle
Felicie from me; in her peculiar parlance
she will tell you she adores dragees,"—the
Cure made a wry face as he uttered the
words; " and make haste home now, for
look at those masses of cloud to the west;
we shall have rain in no time; and just feel
how cold the wind has grown. All our fine
days are over."


* The poorest person, upon the occasion of a
christening, presents the officiating priest with a box of dragees
(sugared almonds).
<!-- Leaf 235, Page: 217 -->

Vevette hurried down the steep path with
her companion, not knowing why the Cure's
parting words had struck her with a sudden
chill. It seemed to her as though all her
fine days were at an end.


And sure enough the weather did change,
and wind and rain howled and pelted all the
night, and the morning rose upon as gloomy
a "jour des morts " as any inhabitant of
D cared to remember. At a little after
nine the tolling of the church bell apprised
the population that mass for the souls of
the dead would soon be chanted, and from
almost every house or shop-door you saw
individuals of both sexes and all ages
issuing; for whatever the religious opinions of
Frenchmen or women, this is a fete from
which they are rarely absent. The bell
toUed on for more than half an hour, till, at
<!-- Leaf 236, Page: 218 -->
ten o'clock, it ceased, marking the moment
when High Mass began.


The church of D was, like many of
those in the west of France, built at various
periods; destroyed during the barbarous
wars of the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries,—for which destruction we English
had a good deal to answer,—and
re-constructed according to the style of the epoch
following those troubles. It had a crypt,
which with a part of the wall at the back of
the choir was of the tenth century, the nave
was of the fifteenth, and the chief entrance,
with its pointed Gothic arch and rich stone
carvings, bore the date of 1508. Inside it
was very plain, but possessed a few objects
of local interest,—one handsome tomb of a
princess of the House of Anjou; another,
quite modern, of a distinguished Polish
<!-- Leaf 237, Page: 219 -->
exile; and several partially-filled windows
of extremely fine old stained-glass. The
Revolution had committed great havoc here,
and vast spaces of dull lead-coloured panes
intervened between the rescued portions of
colour, gorgeous as the richest tissues of the
East, and quite sufficient, when the sun
blazed upon them in midsummer, to throw a
carpet of red, blue, and gold upon the stone
pavement of the aisles.


There was no brightening ray, however,
to enliven the church on this 2nd of
November. All was dismal as the occasion
itself. The altar was hung with black,
and dimly lighted, and in the centre of
the nave rose a large, heavy-looking edifice
draped in black cloth, covered with silver
flames, surmounted with black and white
plumes, and surrounded with tall, great
<!-- Leaf 238, Page: 220 -->
tapers, the yellow wax wherefrom guttered
down in the draughts of air that entered
through every opening. At a little after
nine you began to hear the sharp sound of
sabots upon the floor. They came in one
by one; the closing door gave a muffled
slam, the ring of an umbrella dropping upon
the pavement produced a metallic sound,
the wooden heels tapped against the stone,
a half-drenched, poorly-dressed peasant made
his, or her, way up to the wooden benches,
and all was again still. Till just before
mass was commenced only the very devout
were visible, and these were mostly country
people,—what in France are called
cultivateurs,—and their famdies. During the
procession round the church, there were
few of the townsfolk, but all who were
present followed the procession, and joined
<!-- Leaf 239, Page: 221 -->
in the ghostly chants which the ritual of
Rome prescribes for this part of the
ceremony. One of the earhest of these
assistants was the woodcutter, Prosper Morel,
ancl though he came the very last in the
line following the banner and the priests,
he seemed foremost of all in the fervour
of spirit with which he joined the ardent
invocations of the Church. His coarse,
much patched, ancl darned blouse was
wet through, for apparently he had no
umbrella, and a broad-brimmed grey hat
was crushed between his two horny hands,
which he held clasped together on his
breast, and in an attitude of agonised
entreaty. With head high uplifted, and
eyes staring, as it were, through the very
roof above him, the uncouth-looking Breton
pom-ed forth the ever-recurring " Libera
<!-- Leaf 240, Page: 222 -->
me" with tremendous force, and in a
strangely funereal tone. When the
procession was ended, Prosper retired to a
vacant corner close to a lateral door right
opposite the pulpit, and knelt down upon
the pavement, seemingly having no place
upon any of the wooden benches.


Somewhat before ten o'clock the real
congregation began to pour in, and Monsieur
le Maire took his place in the carved oak
state-pew in front of the pulpit, where, on
worm-eaten old chairs, covered with
motheaten red velvet, the notables and worthies
of the parish were entitled to sit. M. de
Verancour and Richard Prevost, by reason
of their importance in the parochial
administration, sat there also. In the centre
of the church were ranged the various heads
of the society of D—■—, chiefly
<!-- Leaf 241, Page: 223 -->
remarkable from the different degrees of richness
of their respective prie-dieus. There were
the doctor and his mother, wife, and
chUdren, and the notary with his wife,
and the schoolmaster, and the hotel-keeper,
and the Juge de Paix, with his wife and
a lanky boy. The Juge de Paix, who was
a "phdosophe," was remarkable for never
kneehng; he went to church because that
was fitting in his position, but he stood
when others knelt, and thought that this
concihated personal independence with
respect for the forms honoured by the State.


When the Cure mounted the altar-steps
and began to recite the " Introito," there
was not a person of any note in the town
absent from the church. Madame Jean, in
very handsome mourning, had, on the whole,
the finest prie-dieu of all,—tapestry-work,
<!-- Leaf 242, Page: 224 -->
red poppies, blue corn-flowers, and a white
cross in the middle. The brigadier de
gendarmerie was splendidly got up.  
  
  
  When the terrible chant of the " Dies

Iræ" wailed and moaned through the
chiu-ch, many a head was bowed down,
and although nothing could exceed the
discordance of the sounds on which the
awful words were borne, and although the
drone of the serpent, out of tune and out
of time, and confided to the musical
aptitudes of a fanatical cobbler, verged
upon the ridiculous, nothing seemed felt
but the dread of the future and the grief
for the lost. Poor little Vevette was
observed to sob bitterly as she hid her head
in her handkerchief, and both old Morville
and his son Raoul covered theh- faces with
their hats. Richard Prevost was pale, and
<!-- Leaf 243, Page: 225 -->
looked Ul, and old Prosper, still on his
knees in his corner, was intent upon his
large-beaded rosary, and mumbled over it
like one of the cripples in his own province
on his way to a " pardon."


When the Gospel had been read, the
Cure ascended the pulpit, and, as it is
the custom in country churches, prepared
to address a few words to his hearers upon
the special import of the day's service.


The Cure was no orator, and he knew it,
and never attempted to make elaborate
discourses, which, had they been the finest
in the world, would have been lost upon
his hearers. His sermons were generally
short and to the point, and merely aimed
at impressing his auditory with the reality
and comprehensibility of the Christian
doctrine, and at bringing home to their minds  
  
  
  vol. i. G
<!-- Leaf 244, Page: 226 -->
the true sense of whatever might be the
particular lesson of the day.


His subject on this 2nd of November
was already found;—it was death. Few
among us who have passed their childhood
do not respond to the melancholy of that
theme ! And so the congregation of the
church of D listened to the Cure's
homely words with rapt attention, and
dwelt anew in anguish upon the beloved
who were for ever gone.


\"For ever ! " There was the mystery—
the terror or the hope; and there, of course,
the priest, full of faith, strove to bring over
every individual Ustener to grasp, as it
were, with his hand the reasons for
believing. Stifled sobs and low wailings answered
his appeal, and no eloquence was needed to
touch even the most rugged hearts on this
<!-- Leaf 245, Page: 227 -->
one point where all had suffered. The
howling of the wind without, and the
plashing of the rain, made a gloomy
accompaniment to the scene.


When his short address was nearly ended,
the Cure paused, and then in a few
sentences adverted to the horrible crime by
which the hitherto peaceful town had been
affrighted,—the murder of Martin Prevost.
"We have not only felt the grief ancl the
sorrow of death," said he, " but the terror
of death has visited us;—death in its most
dreadful form, the form of murder! And
the murderer is unpunished, unsuspected !"


And then, leaning forwards upon the
cushion in front of the pulpit, and speaking
more slowly than before, he thus continued
his discourse:—"I would wish you all,"
said he with extreme earnestness, "to study
<!-- Leaf 246, Page: 228 -->
the last words of to-day's Gospel, for you
will see how they apply to the terrible
mystery which so shocks us all." Placing
his finger upon the page of the book open
before him—"Listen!" he added; "'For
the hour will come in which all who are in
theh* tombs will hear the voice of the Son
of God. And those who have acted
righteously will arise, and theirs shall be
the resurrection to life; and those who have
done evil will also arise, but only to be
judged.' Now, my brethren, these are not
vain words; these are facts. It is good
you should look upon them as such. We
are regretful at this moment that the
evildoer should have escaped, for his escape
might have called down wrong and misery
upon the innocent, and it is God's mercy
alone which has allowed it to be clearly
<!-- Leaf 247, Page: 229 -->
proved that among our neighbours stands no
murderer : but, my brethren, the evil-doer
has not escaped; it is but a reprieve;—it is
only for a few months, or weeks, or days.
He cannot escape, my brethren; no one can
escape; for when that hour of which we are
told strikes, the murderer will rise, but by
his side will be the man he murdered!
Perhaps even now he is trying to forget,
perhaps he has forgotten; but the hour will
come,—come as surely as that I am
standing here,—and when he gets out of his
grave he will see over again what he hoped
never to see more. He wiU see the
bloodstained head and face; and the eyes, whose
death-glare he did not see, will stare at him,
and Martin Prevost will clutch his hand and
lead him up to the eternal tribunal. They
will stand there together face to face."
<!-- Leaf 248, Page: 230 -->

These words, whereby the Cure had
merely intended to impress on his hearers
the certainty of retribution, and the
matterof-fact truth of Gospel teachings, seemed
to have struck a strange terror into the
entire congregation. The remainder of
mass was attended to in silence, and the
departing crowd exchanged silent greetings
on the threshold of the church. The wind
still howled pitifully, and the rain beat
against the windows, and the lowering grey
sky looked like a pall.


When the last parishioner had departed,
Raoul de Morvdle left his father's side and
went back into the church to fetch the
prayer-book he had mislaid upon his chair.
"Why, Prosper, what's the matter?" he
exclaimed, as, on turning round to go out
by the side-door, he saw the woodcutter still
<!-- Leaf 249, Page: 231 -->
on his knees, with his rosary in his hand,
but motionless. The man's head was thrown
back, and rested upon the stone carvings of
the holy-water font; his eyes were wide
open, and so was his mouth; but nor look
nor breath nor sound came from either. His
fingers were closed tightly over his beads.
He was apparently in a trance or a fit.


Raoul shook him, and threw water from
the font over him, but he was some minutes
before he recalled him to himself. When
consciousness did return, he shrank from
Raoul as from a reptile, gathered himself up,
and, quivering with fear, fixed his dull,
scared look upon Raoul with an expression
of horror quite indescribable.


The beadle came by to see that no one
lingered in the church, and young Morville
recommended the Breton to his care.
<!-- Leaf 250, Page: 232 -->

In the end Prosper consented to rise and
make his way out of the church, but he
went alone, fiercely resenting any attempts
to lead him out with an inarticulate groan,
and with a look that at once was full of
hatred and terror. The beadle shrugged his
shoulders. " The old fellow's head never
was good for much," he mumbled; " ancl
what with the murder and his own
imprisonment, it's all topsy-turvy now,—il a
demenage, pauvre bonhomme! " and the
beadle tapped his forehead with his fat
forefinger.

  CHAPTER XI.  
  
  
  MADEMOISELLE FELICIE's HUSBAND.

The "fortnight" which Monsieur de
Verancour had begged from De Champmorin's
notary was past, and another week added
to it, and still there was no news of the
money, and the suspense endured by the
unfortunate Vicomte was becoming
intolerable; and various slight signs were here
and there appearing of Mademoiselle
Felicie's matrimonial defeat being likely to
stand revealed to the general public. It
was really beyond bearing ! And the worst
<!-- Leaf 252, Page: 234 -->
of it was, that it was impossible not to be
grateful to poor, good, patiently-toiling
Monsieur Richard for the manifest trouble he
was taking. He never totally deprived the
sorely perplexed father of hope, never
announced to him the failure of his
negotiations, or put himself in the position of a
man who had done his utmost and could
do no more; but, on the contrary, played
with his sohcitor after the most tantalising
fashion, and was for ever showing him a
chance of the attainment of their ends.
Their ends !—for of his zeal in the cause
of the famdy, Monsieur Richard left no
doubt. And the Vicomte felt it was the
"family," the house of Verancour, which
was being served;—and that was as it
should be. It would have been
presumptuous in Monsieur Richard to have tried
<!-- Leaf 253, Page: 235 -->
to render a service to the Vicomte, out of
personal friendship; whereas, besides being
convenient, it was creditable to a man like
Richard Prevost to wish so ardently to
serve the interests of an illustrious race.
And from the point of view of " ma
maison," as Monsieur le Vicomte would
perpetually repeat to himself, it was
gratifying to observe the plebeian's devotion,
while it did away with the necessity for
any personal gratitude, which was also
pleasing.


Such was Monsieur Richard's desire to
obtain for his noble patron the sum required
for the establishment of Mademoiselle
Felicie, that he was for ever acquainting him
with some new plan that his untiring
ingenuity had devised, and that must be certain
to succeed;—onlv just in the teeth of this
<!-- Leaf 254, Page: 236 -->
\"certainty," something of the most
impossible kind invariably occurred which
dashed all the seemingly so well-founded
hopes to the ground. There was only one
simple operation that Monsieur Richard
never proposed; and that was to dispose
of any securities of his own at a great loss,
and bring the proceeds to the Vicomte.
No ! it was always a question of "raising"
the money from some one else, and in this
transaction Monsieur Richard was doomed
to perpetual disappointment. As to buying
the " Grandes Bruyeres," as his uncle had
been ready to do, that was utterly out of
the question. Monsieur Richard had no
ready money; everything was absorbed
by this purchase of the Chateaubreville
estate.  
  
  
  " It is a very heavy responsibility," said
<!-- Leaf 255, Page: 237 -->
Monsieur Richard, one evening when he
was sitting with the famdy at the Chateau,
round the smouldering fire, " a very heavy
responsibility;" and he sighed, and
ventured to take up Vevette's scissors from the
table and examine them attentively.


Monsieur de Verancour placed his two
haVds on his knees, bending forwards, and
looking intently at the toes of his thick
boots. "Well!" rejoined he, with a kind
of grunt, " I confess it passes me to make
out why you have done it. I should call
it a terrible imprudence. To go and saddle
yourself with land,—with a very
considerable landed property indeed !—when nothing
obliges you to do so. I confess that goes
beyond me;" and the Vicomte threw
himself back in his chair as if he gave the
problem up in despair. " That we,"
<!-- Leaf 256, Page: 238 -->
continued he, after a momentary pause, "should
go on impoverishing ourselves to keep up
old historic memories, and prevent the
glorious sound of old names from being
lost in the horrid roar of Revolutions,—that
is comprehensible; it is one of the many
sacrifices to which our noblesse obliges us.
And how many are there of us who can
do it, even ? Not one in a hundred. We,
who are identical with the soil, we are
forced to sell it."


\"Perhaps," suggested timidly Monsieur
Richard, " perhaps that is why we buy it."


But the Vicomte did not seem at all
impressed by the force of this argument; for,
unheeding the interruption, he continued,
"You people of the new school, you
nouveaux riches, are so completely free !
Nothing trammels or binds you. You
<!-- Leaf 257, Page: 239 -->
can absolutely do whatever you choose;
you have nothing to keep up—no
traditions, no names, no ancestors who have a
right to expect from you the sacrifice of
all mere worldly advantages to the respect
for their dignity. We are trammelled,
fettered, chained down on all sides, whilst
you are free as air. And yet you are
always seeking to forge some chain for
yourselves. Land, forsooth ! land ! that it
is with which you nouveaux riches are
always burdening yourselves."


"It is possible," edged in meekly
Monsieur Richard, " that we may wish to found
something."


\"Found what?" exclaimed the Vicomte,
with truly superb disdain. " It takes ages
to found an order in the state. Nobody
founded us. We were! What was the
<!-- Leaf 258, Page: 240 -->
use of putting us down ? Found, indeed !
I should like to know what the men oftoday, the men without names, can found ?"


\"Not an old nobility, certainly," replied
Monsieur Richard gently, and with a smile,
\"but perhaps a new aristocracy."


\"Whew!" half whistled Monsieur de
Verancour, with a supremely contemptuous
curl of the lip. "That takes four
generations at least, and heaps of money ! " And,
getting up and standing with his back to
the fire, he continued, " Why, now, look at
what you're doing. When you've bought
and paid for the Chateaubreville property,
you'll have to put it in order, and restore
the house,—it's shockingly out of repair,—
and furnish it."


\"There's a great deal of splendid old
furniture in it," interrupted Richard Prevost.
<!-- Leaf 259, Page: 241 -->

"Yes; but old—-very old," retorted the
Vicomte; " out of keeping with the habits
of modern " he seemed at a loss for a
proper term, " of modern " he hesitated
again.


\"You mean out of keeping with the
habits of la petite bourgeoisie," said
Richard, coming to his assistance. " But,
Monsieur le Vicomte," added he, "I intend
to furnish, and I hope keep up
Chateaubreville on a scale not quite unfitting the
importance of the place."


\"The deuce you do, my dear fellow.
Why, then, you'll not be able to do it under
a hunch-ed thousand francs a year."


"I do not count upon doing it for so
little," answered humbly Monsieur Richard.


\"Peste ! " ejaculated Monsieur de
Verancour, and the look which accompanied the  
  
  
  VOL. I. B
<!-- Leaf 260, Page: 242 -->
expression seemed to say, " Where have
these canaille stolen all this gold ?"


A hundred thousand francs of income !
Oh, the magic of those few words !
MademoiseUe Felicie let her tapestry drop upon
her lap, and surveyed poor Monsieur
Richard from under her eyelids with such a
strange look, but a gracious one decidedly.


\"Diable !" pursued the Vicomte. "Well,
then, you may make a marriage,—a good
marriage; it will be in your power to marry
a well-born ghl without a fortune."


"If you would help—would guide me,"
murmured Richard.


\"I know of none such," retorted the
Vicomte haughtily; " but I know that in
Paris, for instance, there are plenty of
reduced families who will give theh'
daughters to anybody who is rich. It is quite
<!-- Leaf 261, Page: 243 -->
a thing of the present day, quite a new
thing in France. It has been for nearly
two centuries the practice to renovate the
lustre of ancient names by marrying the
eldest sons of illustrious houses to large
fortunes embodied in base-born girls. There
you have the " savonnette a vilain" of the
Regency and of Louis XV., but it is only
recently that nobly-born girls have been
sacrificed to become the mothers of
shopkeepers. However, so it is now, and certain
it is that money can do anything.
Therefore, my dear Monsieur Richard, as I said
before, if you have a hundred thousand
francs a year to spend, I do not see why
you should not marry a wife whom the
ladies of the province should visit."


Monsieur Richard bowed low and
deferentially, as though he felt the full value
<!-- Leaf 262, Page: 244 -->
of the announcement made to him, and
nothing in his manner indicated that he
was other than flattered by the Vicomte's
behaviour; for, in truth, the Vicomte meant
to be particularly kind, affable, and
condescending, patronising, nay, — even
paternal.


Mademoiselle Felicie, by reason of the
thirty years' difference of age between
herself and her father, saw things in a slightly
different light, ancl was just capable of
understanding that Monsieur Richard might
be anything but flattered by her parent's
naively contemptuous familiarity; and when
their visitor rose to go, she proceeded to
a small side-table in the half-lighted
drawing-room and asked him if he would not
take a glass of eau sucree. Upon his
acceptance of that favour, she mixed the
<!-- Leaf 263, Page: 245 -->
harmless beverage for him herself, tendered
it to him, and as she did so, allowed her
white hand unconsciously to touch his,
lingered for a few seconds ere she
relinquished her hold upon the glass, and with
a perfectly angelic look asked Monsieur
Richard if he were quite sure there was
sugar enough in the water.


And then another week went by, and it
seemed somehow or other to be becoming
known that Mademoiselle Felicie would not
marry Monsieur de Champmorin. How it
had transpired no one could say; but it
was thought to be traceable to the
Champmorin notary, who in moments of effusion
and confidential talk with trusted friends,
had discoursed upon the impossibility of
girls marrying without money, and had
unguardedly alluded to his chent as " much
<!-- Leaf 264, Page: 246 -->
to be pitied "—insinuating, as it were, that
Mademoiselle Felicie,—having been faUen in
love with, unprovided as she was with any dot,
—could not be held altogether blameless.


Richard Prevost abstained for three days
from going near the Chateau. On the
fourth Monsieur de Verancour sought him.
Monsieur Richard was warming himself
before a huge, blazing fire in his study,
when a loud ring was heard at the door
bell, a loud footstep quickly followed it in
the hall, and dispensing with Madame
Jean's attendance, Monsieur le Vicomte
opened the door for himself, and stalked
into the room.


\"Well, there it is at last!" he
exclaimed, throwing himself into a chair and
letting his brown felt hat drop on the floor
beside him. " I always thought it would
<!-- Leaf 265, Page: 247 -->
come to this with all these confounded
delays; and now there it is ! S mille
tonnerres de Dieu !" And all those good
principles which were to keep this
"rightthinking " fils des croises from swearing,
flew to the winds, and he indulged in the
comfort of a string of oaths, as if he had
been no more than one of those
long-forgotten Saulnier forefathers of his, picking
up salt in the Breton marshes.


\"I beseech of you," entreated Monsieur
Richard, rising, " do not give up hope. I
have, on the contrary, good news. I should
have gone to see you last evening if the
weather had not been so bad and my cough
troublesome, but I was going down to the
Chateau now. I have a letter from an old
friend of my poor uncle's in Nantes, and I
am positively not without hopes that perhaps
<!-- Leaf 266, Page: 248 -->
even a sale of Les Grandes Bruyeres might
be possible. Here, I will read you the
letter. I got it yesterday." And Monsieur
Richard began busily throwing over the
letters ancl papers before him.


"The devil take your letter!" stormed
the Vicomte; "what do all the letters in
the world matter now ? Why Champmorin
refuses! " And striding up to the table,
Monsieur de Verancour brought his hand
down upon it with a heavy thump, and the
two men looked each other in the face.


\"Re—fu—ses ! " stammered out Richard
Prevost. " Oh ! Monsieur le Vicomte, I am
constrained to say I cannot master the sense
of those words. Monsieur de Champmorin
refuses the honour of being the husband of
Mademoiselle de Verancour ! "  
  
  
  The exasperated parent was somewhat
<!-- Leaf 267, Page: 249 -->
mollified at sight of Monsieur Richard's
indignation. " Read that," said he, handing
over to him a letter.


Monsieur Richard did read, and was
seemingly overpowered by what he read, for
his countenance was thoroughly what his
countrymen term "bouleverse" when he
returned the paper to its owner.


"You will admit," observed the latter,
\"that nothing is left for me to do. It is as
complete a conge as can well be given, and,
moreover, couched in such respectful and
mournful terms that probably public opinion
would expect me to condole with the
writer."


Richard Prevost took the letter back into
his hand, pored over it anew, and then
replied with an air and in a tone of supreme
depression.
<!-- Leaf 268, Page: 250 -->

\"No ! " he sighed, as though vanquished
by fate, "there is nothing left to do,—
nothing !"


Monsieur de Verancour sprang from his
seat, and paced up and down the room.
"Nothing!" echoed he, with stentorian
lungs; " that is exactly what drives me
mad ! I feel ready to shoot myself because
I have no earthly pretext for shooting
Champmorin ! "


\"Good God ! " exclaimed Richard Prevost
in a tone of downright agony, " to think of
such a thing ! A demoiselle de Verancour
refused by a mere country gentleman !
Refused ! Such a person as Mademoiselle
Felicie !—such birth and position !—such a
name ! "


The Vicomte went on pacing up and
down and muttering, and Monsieur Richard
<!-- Leaf 269, Page: 251 -->
went on watching him without being
noticed.


\"One thing must at all events be seen
to," ejaculated Richard, as though struck by
a sudden inspiration. " The whole must be
kept secret; it must never be known
that "


\"Not known ! " thundered the Vicomte.
"WeU, my good sir, one sees what it is to
Uve out of the world as you do ! Why, it
is known already. Everybody knows it.
It was known before it was true ! These
things always are ! "


\"So that," groaned Monsieur Richard,
\"it will be public throughout the province
that Mademoiselle FeUcie—Ma-de-moi-selle
FeUcie,"—and he dwelt on every syllable
solemnly,—"has been given up, discarded,
refused ! It is too dreadful! " " Can
<!-- Leaf 270, Page: 252 -->
nothing be done ? " recommenced Monsieur
Richard, with a kind of timid eagerness, after
a silence of a few moments.  
  
  
  "What?" rejoined Monsieur de Veran

cour.


\"Indeed, it is hard to say," rejoined the
other sadly; " but surely it would be
possible to find some remedy. Anything would
be preferable to the present position."


\"I should think it would, indeed!"
retorted bitterly Monsieur de Verancour.


"Well, but—" suggested hesitatingly
Monsieur Richard, "could no other parti be
found?"


"Where?" cried the Vicomte. "Do
you fancy, my worthy Monsieur Richard,
that husbands for discarded young ladies
are to be found by beating the woods for
them, and that they come as snakes do
<!-- Leaf 271, Page: 253 -->
when they smell the catcher's pot of
boiling milk ? * No, thank you ! No dot, no
husband! Where is there one anywhere
round ? Look through the department.
Why, there's not even an old invalid, wanting
a nurse,—not even a mesalliance to be
got! "


Monsieur Richard fell to musing, and the
Vicomte went on walking up and down, but
he did seem comforted by the talk he was
having. " Monsieur le Vicomte," at length
said, in a low and unsteady tone, Richard
Prevost; " there is a mesalliance, if
Mademoiselle Felicie would consent to that. I
know of one—a very—an extremely rich
parti."  
  
  
  " The devil you do ! " broke in Monsieur


* In Poitou it is a trade to catch snakes, and the
catchers attract them by boiling milk.
<!-- Leaf 272, Page: 254 -->
de Verancour, stopping short in his walk.
\"Where is he to be found ? Who is he ? "
Richard Prevost was pale as a ghost, so pale
that the edge of his eyelids seemed quite
pink, as he looked hesitatingly at his
interlocutor. "Well!" exclaimed the latter,
\"where is he ? who is he ? "


\"It is me, myself! " gasped out Monsieur
Richard, under his breath. The stare of
blank astonishment with amusement mixed,
with which his proposal was met, was not
likely to be ever forgotten by the unlucky
suitor, whose white face turned scarlet with
shame.


\"You ? " echoed Monsieur de Verancour.
"You?" And then struggling with the
strong sense of the ridiculous, " You ?" he
shouted a third time. The apparent fun of
the thing fairly mastered him, and he roared
<!-- Leaf 273, Page: 255 -->
with laughter, as he threw himself into the
nearest chair and held his sides.


The Vicomte's fit of hilarity lasted long
enough for Monsieur Richard to determine
upon what attitude he should assume. He
assumed one of injured dignity, and
reminded his hearer, when he was able to
attend to him, that he was exceedingly rich,
and that his offer was a proof of his
devotion to the house of Verancour.


Conversation was not easy after this
incident, and so the Vicomte soon prepared to
take his leave. When he did so, he held
out his hand to Monsieur Richard, and
spoke again to his young friend with his
features not yet quit of the laugh that had
convulsed them. "There shall be no
rancour about it!" said he, with jovial
graciousness. "I am sure you meant it well,
<!-- Leaf 274, Page: 256 -->
but you know it ready was too droll. I
ought to apologise for laughing so
immoderately, but, on my honour, it was irresistible.
However I shan't forget the intention, and I
assure you, you have done me good; it has
been quite a distraction." And, with a
good-humoured shake of the hand, he left
the room and the house, and once in the
street, had another laugh to himself.


Whether Monsieur de Verancour would
have altogether Uked the look with which
Monsieur Richard followed him when his
back was turned, is another question.
<!-- Leaf 275 -->
  
  CHAPTER XII.  
  
  
  RAOUL's DISTRESS.

Just before the end of October a little
incident had occurred which had frightened
D " from its propriety," and afforded
the old cronies of the place an opportunity
for declaring that the end of the world was
coming. It had become known that
Monsieur Leon Duprez, that most magnificent
"cock of the walk," whose example, said
the elders, was so disastrous for the young
generation, had sailed for Australia, under a
feigned name, thus escaping at once from  
  
  
  vol. i. s
<!-- Leaf 276, Page: 258 -->
his debtors and his admiring townsfolk, from
his colleagues on various Boards, and from
Madame Josephine Le Vaillant, the wife of
the Juge de Paix. Naturally this was " un
evenement," and, what with one thing and
another, the little town of D did appear
to be aping its betters, and losing all right to
be denominated a " quiet retreat."


In the course of time,—that is, towards
the first days of November,—what are
termed " proceedings " were taken against
Monsieur Duprez's property, and his house
and furniture were to be put up for sale;
though the reports of what his debts in
Paris amounted to made any price that
might be reached by the disposal of his
paternal estate seem a mere " drop in the
ocean."  
  
  
  All this really was very agitating for the
<!-- Leaf 277, Page: 259 -->
public mind of D Here, in less than
a month, had there been a murder, a
financial break-up,—or, as the commentators
delighted to call it, a " scandal,"—and a
matrimonial alliance broken off !


In the midst of such exciting events the
fact that Raoul de Morville was going up to
Paris to be a clerk in the Marine Ministry,
passed unnoticed. And, above all, it entered
no one's head that there could be any
possible connection between his acceptance of
official drudgery in a subordinate position
and the ruin of the some-time "cock of the
walk " who had been his intimate friend.


Old Morville spoke but little with his.
neighbours, but to the few whom he met he
grunted out the announcement of his son's
approaching departure, and received a most
hurnihating meed of pity in exchange; for,
<!-- Leaf 278, Page: 260 -->
being universally disliked, pity seemed the
natural vexation to inflict upon him, and he
got plenty of it.


Raoul came to say good-bye to his friends
at the Chateau, and found the Vicomte
together with his two daughters.


\"I'm sincerely rejoiced you came to-day
instead of to-morrow," said Monsieur de
Verancour.  
  
  
  " I go to-morrow," interrupted Raoul


\"If you would let me finish, I meant to
say that to-morrow you would have found
no one here," continued the Vicomte; " for
we have to drive over to the Grandes
Bruyeres, and shall be away the whole day,
and I would not have missed seeing you for
a great deal, mon garcon. I shall always
feel a real interest in you, for you put us
all in mind of happier times,—of the times
<!-- Leaf 279, Page: 261 -->
when your mother and theirs,"—pointing to
his daughters,—" were both alive. I shall
be heartily glad to hear of your well-doing,
and of your advancement."


At the moment when Monsieur de
Verancour had mentioned the journey of the next
day to the Grandes Bruyeres, a glance,
quick as Ughtning, was exchanged between
Raoul and Vevette, who was seated
somewhat behind her father. It was only the
work of one second, for the girl lowered her
eyes instantly to her work, and blushed
crimson.


The leave-taking, when it came, was an
affectionate one, and while the two young
ladies shook hands cordially with their
parting guest, the Vicomte embraced him with
genuine tenderness, and specially enjoined
upon him to write to them from Paris.
<!-- Leaf 280, Page: 262 -->

It is, probably, needless to inform my
readers that, the next day, only Felicie
accompanied her father upon the projected
excursion. Vevette discovered an excuse
for remaining at home, and at home she
stayed, and was virtually alone in the house.
Celeste, the all-pervading functionary, was
at all times too glad not to be summoned
from her lawful dominions in the vast
subterranean kitchens of the once grand old
dwelhng, and from her Vevette knew she
was safe. Baptiste, the " man of all work,"
was absent with the carriage, and had put
on his old livery to look like a coachman;
his wife, old Suzette, who was the most
dangerous person of the lot, was weeding in
the garden, and doing some work set out for
her by her spouse in the artichoke beds.
She was not to be got rid of, or eluded;
<!-- Leaf 281, Page: 263 -->
that Vevette well knew, for Suzette was a
lynx-eyed old woman, and moreover her
employment fixed her right opposite the
pavilion. Nothing was left for it then but
to receive Raoul inside the house. It was
for the last time, and Vevette, after a great
deal of discussion with herself, and with
much of what she beheved to be resistance,
yielded.


Raoul waited behind some trees just
outside the garden wall to the south,—in a
spot which no one ever passed. About
three o'clock Vevette came, and gave him a
signal; he climbed the wall, followed
the girl sdently, and in a few seconds was
alone with her in the usual sitting-room of

the famdy.


Mute and mournful were the first
greetings of the pah-; but, in the midst of what
<!-- Leaf 282, Page: 264 -->
was the natural grief attendant on their
parting, it seemed as though some other
trouble lay hidden, and each marked this in
the other. As Raoul held in his the hand of
the sin-inking girl, "Vevette," he exclaimed
bitterly, " why do you shrink from me in
this way ? what is it you shrink from ?"
Vevette cast an anxious glance around her.
Raoul shook his head: " It is not that! " he
said impatiently. " You are not alarmed
lest we should be surprised; you know that
no one will come near this room for hours;
that we are perfectly safe; that there are
half-a-dozen ways of escaping if one heard
but a mouse stir. No; that is not it. I am
not deceived by the look that you send
wandering out from your eyes all around us,
for I see the look that lies behind it. What
is it, Vevette ? what is it ? Sometimes it
<!-- Leaf 283, Page: 265 -->
seems to me as though there were a
phantom, a dreadful something, that would
always rise up between us, even when we are
man and wife." And he tried to draw her
close to him, but she still shrank and
trembled. " Vevette ! " he urged in a softer
tone, pressing her hand in both his own.
\"I am going. We may not meet for
months. It is the last time we can speak
together, the very last time; I have but
one hope, but one comfort in the world,—
your love. Do you look upon your promise
to me as a sacred one ? "  
  
  
  A faint "Yes," escaped her lips.


\"Do you count upon mine to you as
absolutely as though I had solemnly pledged
you my faith at the altar ? "


This time the girl looked up, and looked
straight and unabashed into her lover's eyes,
<!-- Leaf 284, Page: 266 -->
as she answered distinctly, " Oh ! that
indeed I do."


\"Then, Vevette, my own love," he
rejoined, throwing his arms impetuously
round her, " what can it be that you fear ?
For God's sake, tell me. Do not let me go
with this weight upon my heart. What is
it that you dread, my wife, my surely to
be wedded wife ? "


\"Oh ! Raoul! Raoul! " cried she,
burying her face in her hands, " the sin ! the
sin ! the fault that must not be forgiven,—
the sin that wiU never leave us ! "


He partially loosened his hold of her, and
whilst one arm encircled her waist, and he
sought with -the other to draw her hands
from her burning cheeks. " Vevette," he
said, in a tone that was almost stern;
\"you are wanting in respect to yourself,
<!-- Leaf 285, Page: 267 -->
wanting in respect to my wife, whom I have
worshipped as a saint. What sin have you
ever committed, Vevette ? Your own
scrupulousness is less pure than greater
ignorance would be. I know where the fault
lies;—in the teachings of your convent; in
the gloomy, narrow, false, impious teachings
of people who do not know that true love is
bright, strong, and pure as steel or flame.
Answer me, dear; is marriage an
institution, sanctified by the Church ? Is the
marriage vow blessed ? Is marriage a
sacrament ? "


\"Of [course it is," murmured she, with
downcast eyes.


\"And you beheve that when girls give
themselves away in marriage to husbands
who are at least totaUy indifferent to them,
the bond is a holy one, and the wives are
<!-- Leaf 286, Page: 268 -->
blessed among women ! Do you ever ask
yourself, Vevette, why some wives are
faithless ? "


\"Because they are tempted by the Evil
One," said Vevette timidly.


\"No, my sweet one," continued Raoul,
looking tenderly at her and softly stroking
her hair. " It is because they do not love
their husbands, and it is dangerous to
ask from the weak creatures that we are
more than is humanly possible."


\"But, Raoul," hesitatingly whispered she,
"it is wrong;—the Church forbids it."


\"God does not forbid it," answered he,
gravely. " His Word nowhere forbids it.
Suppose, my own, we were married this
very day, would it still be wrong that you
should love me?"  
  
  
  Poor Vevette trembled, and blushed, and
<!-- Leaf 287, Page: 269 -->
looked the very picture of distress and
confusion, as she attempted to reply. " Yes,
dear Raoul," stammered she, "it would
always be wrong. It is a sin,—a dreadful
sin,—and God will punish us. It is a
dreadful sin for a woman to love her
husband even, as—as—I—love you ! " she
faintly uttered at last.


Raoul folded her gently, almost
paternally, to his breast. " Poor chdd ! " he
said in avery mournful tone; "and so, it
is not the circumstances of the love, not its
concealment, not the momentary untruth,—
no ! it is the love itself which is the sin!
poor little one ! " And he remained silent
and thoughtful for some time, with Vevette's
head lying upon his shoulder and his own
head resting upon her brow.  
  
  
  More than an hour went by, and young
<!-- Leaf 288, Page: 270 -->
Morvdle tried to make his future bride
comprehend her duties to him and to herself,
and he succeeded in so far as that she
agreed to subordinate all other
considerations to her passionate devotion for him;
but that the devotion itself was sinful,—
that being passionate it must be so,—that
remained ineradicable from poor Uttle
Vevette's creed.


"And now, Raoul," pleaded the girl in
her turn, as the moment for separation came,
\"what is the trouble that is hanging over
you ?—for there is one. You have some
other care besides the mere grief, deep as it
is, of leaving. May I not know it? " she
added, looking up imploringly at him.


A cloud darkened Raoul's countenance, he
pressed his lips together, and drew a long
hard breath. " No!" was his rejoinder.
<!-- Leaf 289, Page: 271 -->
"I cannot share that trouble with you,
Vevette."


\"Then you have a trouble ?" she
retorted, eagerly.


\"Most men have; and there are many
that must be borne in solitude and silence.
Some burdens may be shared by those we
love; but some there are that it is not good
to halve, even with one's wife." The tone
in which this was spoken left no room for
further intreaty, and threw a deeper chill
over the final parting of the lovers than
either could have anticipated.


To the sense of utter loneliness which fell
upon Vevette when Raoul was gone, there
was something added which she could not
define; a sort of shadow which prevented
the absolute blank. " Had Raoul a secret ?
what was it ? " that thought occupied her.
<!-- Leaf 290, Page: 272 -->

Scarcely had he left the room through the
window opening on the terrace, when a
knock came at the door. Vevette started,
and bade the visitor enter, with a beating
heart and quivering voice. It was Mere
Jubine's Louison with a letter in her
hand. She tendered it to Vevette with
a curtsey, saying it was from Monsieur
Richard Prevost. When opened it was
found to contain another letter, addressed
to Felicie, and a few hnes by which the
younger sister was humbly requested to
deliver the enclosure to the elder. " It
concerned," observed the writer, " an act of
charity ! "


\"Is Monsieur Richard ill ?" asked
Vevette. The girl said she did not know,
but did not think he was particularly
strong in this damp weather, but that she
<!-- Leaf 291, Page: 273 -->
had promised to deliver the letter. And
then she went away.


Vevette in her natural simphcity and her
present agitation of spirit, did perhaps
think it rather odd that Monsieur Richard
should send a letter to Felicie; but what
faded to strike her as strange was, that Mere
Jubine's Louison should be bis messenger.

  CHAPTER XIII.  
  
  
  A PRUDENT YOUNG LADY.

I have not yet told you how very very
pretty Mademoiselle Felicie was. She was
not lovely;—her sister was that;—neither
was she handsome, or beautiful. In each of
these words there was something above or
something beyond Mademoiselle FeUcie.
But she was that supremely j ohe femme
which a Frenchwoman alone ever is.
Rather under than over the middle height,
the first idea she gave you was that of
perfect proportion. She had not the most
<!-- Leaf 293, Page: 275 -->
beautiful throat, nor the most beautiful arm,
nor hand, nor shoulder, in the world; no one
particular limb reminded you of a statue;
but the whole went together marvellously
well. Each part so fitted the other, the
ensemble was so harmonious, so pleasant to the
eye, that you were charmed without knowing
why, and would have voted to be
insupportable whoever should have attempted
to persuade you that you ought not to be
so. All the lines were soft and rounded
in Felicie's face and figure. In her whole
being there was not an angle, nor anything
abrupt. She was aU grace, all charm.
Her voice was insinuating, her movements
undulating, her looks caressing. She was
precisely that kind of Frenchwoman whom,
if you have the most distant dream of
remaining,—however Uttle,—your own
<!-- Leaf 294, Page: 276 -->
master, you had best never meet. She never
alarms and never releases you.


Her grandmother, la belle Madame de
Verancour, as old Martin Prevost had told
his nephew, had been Felicie's perfect
prototype; and, Heaven knows, her domestic
career had not been one to render the
position of her husband an enviable one. As a
young woman of sixteen before the
Revolution, she had been distinguished by one
exploit only, but that one was enough.
She was reputed to have beaten the famous
Due de Lauzun hollow, and to have
considerably helped to ruin him, whilstabsolutely vanquishing his inconstancy. She
went by the name of "La Provinciale qui a
roue Lauzun," and after the great
catastrophe, she carried her devastations into her
own department, and, till past fifty, levied
<!-- Leaf 295, Page: 277 -->
contributions of all kinds upon the male
population for many leagues round.
Married or single, all paid tribute; and the
eviltongued declared that all classes were
admitted alike to compete for her favom'.
Some went even further, and hinted that
the present Vicomte was the son of a
SousPreset of the Empire, whom she certainly
had managed to preserve from dismissal
under the Restoration.  
  
  
  La belle Madame de Verancour was not of

a rehgious turn of mind. She did not even
grow devout with old age, but died, it was
said, in an altogether unsatisfactory manner.
Her portrait, painted by Madame Lebrun, in
the full costume of her palmy clays of
Versailles, hung in the drawing-room which
the two sisters had arranged at the Chateau;
and when Felicie happened to be alone, she
<!-- Leaf 296, Page: 278 -->
would sit intently gazing at the image, with
a look that was not easdy definable. Was
it envy, or was it merely curiosity ?


Except for the powder which disguised
the wavy chestnut hair,—that thick,
naturally curling, blonde cendre hair, which
Felicie dressed so exquisitely,—except for
that, everything was alike in the too
celebrated Lady of Verancour and her
descendant : the same calm, satin skin, with just
enough of delicate colour to prevent its
being pale; the same small nose, with its
transparent nostrils; the same finely-arched
eyebrows, and strangely fascinating light
hazel eyes; the same—no ! not quite the
same mouth. The epoch had set its stamp
there, and Lauzun's mistress had the rich
full-blossomed lips that perhaps excused
something out of much that they explained;
<!-- Leaf 297, Page: 279 -->
whilst our Mademoiselle de Verancour
possessed lips so thin that they were hardly
more than the edges of the mouth; bright
red lines closing over twin rows of
exquisitely pearl-like teeth,—with also the one
little fault that they were rather pointed,
rather sharp.


That was the impress of the age.
Madame de Verancour, la belle, had been
lavish in every possible sense. This is not
the defect of modern France. One person
in D had even been ungallant enough,
—it was the Doctor, who disliked the
people of the Chateau because they were
all so healthy that they never " consulted !"
—one person had replied to a remark about
Felicie's attractions :—" Attractive, may be;
jolie comme un ange, may be; but that
girl's an attorney !"
<!-- Leaf 298, Page: 280 -->

Mademoiselle Felicie did certainly give
those who had deaUngs with her a notion
that she was practical; but then
irregularity, let alone prodigality, is accounted
such a sin, and to be wanting in order
brings down such reproof upon a woman in
the France of our day!


Hitherto Felicie's field of action had been
a limited one, and her adversaries had been
mostly female ones. Of these she had not
left one unconquered; and at the convent
at Poitiers she was the "pattern-girl," the
example held up by all the
sisters,—excepting only the unfortunate Madame Marie
Claire, who took refuge with Vevette;—and
she had been pronounced dogmatically by
Notre Mere as certain to be an "honour
to her sex," to be eminently wise and
prudent and circumspect; strong against all
<!-- Leaf 299, Page: 281 -->
sentimentahty, and of an equaUy balanced
mind. Monsieur de Verancour, whilst
congratulating himself upon having such a
daughter, was not altogether without a
certain feeling of inferiority when in her
presence, and it had been affirmed by
Celeste, who came herself under Felicie's
direct control, that he was afraid of her.


After Champmorin's withdrawal from the
projected matrimonial engagement, the
Vicomte certainly did feel shghtly
embarrassed, and had not yet made up his mind
as to the precise terms in which he should
impart to his daughter that she was not
likely to be married as soon as had been
supposed.  
  
  
  She saved him all trouble on that point.


"Dear father," she said, one evening, in
the sweetest of aU possible tones, and
<!-- Leaf 300, Page: 282 -->
preliminarily kissing him on the forehead, with
the most touching grace—" Dear father; I
know you have been annoyed,—pained,—
about something that touches me and my
establishment. I can guess what has
happened; and though it is not customary for
a young girl to mix herself up in such
matters, still ours is an exceptional case,
and I feel it incumbent upon me to share
with you the burdens laid upon us by our
position;—by the nobility of our name so
sadly at war with the narrowness of our
means."


"You always were an angel, Felicie,"
exclaimed her father, "but it is not fitting
that "


"I beg your pardon, father," interrupted
she; "it is fitting that we should talk
together over all this, for it is not fitting
<!-- Leaf 301, Page: 283 -->
that our name should go a-begging. The
daughters of illustrious houses are not
constrained to the same little prudish practices
as those of bourgeois origin, and where the
honour of the race is at stake they must lay
aside prejudice, and see what is best to be
done, just as, in other ages, they would, in
the absence of a garrison, have had to defend
the chateau, arms in hand. I know poor
Monsieur de Champmorin has been obliged
to retire."


Monsieur de Verancour made a
movement.


"He is not to be blamed, father,"
resumed FeUcie; "he must not be blamed;
we have nothing to reproach him with, and
it would be unseemly and wrong in us to
bear the slightest ill-wdl towards him."  
  
  
  " I bear him no ill-wiU whatever,"
<!-- Leaf 302, Page: 284 -->
muttered the Vicomte; "but those about him
have talked, and wdl talk, and the position
is a very awkward one."


"Yes, father dear, of course," rejoined
FeUcie, in her very blandest tones; "of
course it is next to impossible to prevent
people like notaries and all that class from
discussing our affairs; they will talk of us;
it is their chief pastime; and,—I don't deny
it,—it faUs naturally very heavy upon girls
like us, to be made the theme of
conversation of all the vulgar little bourgeois of such
a miserable bit of a place as this; but that
is the fault of provincial towns; there is no
other occupation save that of prying into
your neighbours' concerns. If we were in
Paris, instead of being in D, we should
escape all, or nearly all, the immediate
effects of the disaster."
<!-- Leaf 303, Page: 285 -->

Vevette looked up from her tapestry with
amazement.


\"In Paris ?" echoed the Vicomte. "Yes,
probably so, everything passes unnoticed in
Paris, as in all great centres; but what
earthly chance will there ever be of our
being able to get to Paris ?"


There was a pause of a few seconds, and
then Felicie resumed, in a tone of
discouragement, after musing for a few
moments, "To be sure; it is that
perpetual want of money!" and then there
came another sdence.


\"Why is it," asked Vevette, timidly,
\"that so much more money seems required
for two people to live upon when they
marry than each would find more than
sufficient if they remained single ? A single
man can live on very little, a single woman
<!-- Leaf 304, Page: 286 -->
on less, yet, when it is a question of
marrying, ten times their income appears not to be
enough."


"Because, my poor chdd," rejoined
Felicie, dogmatically, " well-born people do
not marry to Uve, but to represent. We
have to uphold our families and our names;
and our duty is to take care that the
children who succeed us are enabled to
support their position in life with dignity. We
have not yet, in spite of all Revolutions,
come to such a state of things as is said to
exist amongst the English, where, I believe,
two individuals actually marry because they
have taken some imaginary fancy for each
other, and in their folly count for nothing
the fortune and social standing of
thenchildren. No! we have not yet come to
that."
<!-- Leaf 305, Page: 287 -->

Monsieur de Verancour gazed at his
eldest daughter with admiration, whde she
propounded her theories of social economy.
\"All that you say is right and wise,"
observed he with a sigh, leaning Ids head
upon his hand; "but unluckily it brings
about one result—the leveUing of
everything before money. Without riches, what
is to be done ? "


"Yes, dear papa," answered Felicie,
submissively; " you are right there, as you
always are, and I can't help thinking it is
wrong and unchristian-Uke in persons of
our caste to despise money as they do "—
(oh ! FeUcie, when do they so ?)—" to look
down upon riches, when riches have so often
been brought to our very feet by
Providence, in order that by uniting with them
we should elevate the rich to our own level,
<!-- Leaf 306, Page: 288 -->
and teach them to be pious and
right-thinking like us."


"Well, I can only say riches were never
brought to my feet," remarked the Vicomte;
"nor do I think that I can be accused of
ever having scorned them."


"If I might venture, dearest father,"
suggested she, with her most caressing air,
\"though it is wandering far away from our
subject, I would say that you were very
hard, quite unmerciful, the other day, to
poor Monsieur Richard." The Vicomte
started, and, turning round, stared his
daughter full in the face. "You quite
abashed and hurt him when he was telling
you of the great fortune he had inherited,
and of what he means to make of
Chateaubreville."  
  
  
  " No, I declare I did not," answered
<!-- Leaf 307, Page: 289 -->
stoutly Monsieur de Verancour; "just the
contrary; I told him that if he had a
hundred thousand francs a year he might
actually marry a lady."


\"Yes," responded Felicie with the
sweetest of all feline glances and accents;
\"but you did not tell it him—kindly."


"Humph! as to that," grunted her father,
\"I don't know how I told it him. I suppose
I told it him just as I would have told it
any other man of his sort."


\"Ah! but you see, father, dear, we
should be so careful of hurting the feelings
of those beneath us. Men don't think of
that,—women do. Poor Monsieur Richard,
you see, is somewhere about the richest man
in the department, besides being the most
amiable and worthy young man in the
world. So perfectly right-thinking. In a  
  
  
  VOL. i. u
<!-- Leaf 308, Page: 290 -->
year's time he wdl be Monsieur de
Chateaubrevdle, with a splendid country house, and
an establishment in Paris, and if,—as you
advised bim to do,—he should marry a
wellborn woman, we shall all go and visit at
Chateaubreville, and we should really treat
him already as a friend."


"Well, so we do!" ejaculated the
Vicomte; " don't I let him dine here with us?
Treat him as a friend! Yes; but I should
like to see you, who theorise so finely,
treating him as an equal."


"We are taught that all men are equal,"
said sweetly Felicie.


"But nobody believes it," retorted the
Vicomte. " Why, I should like to see the
rebuff he would get from you, if he ventured
to ask you to become his wife. Treat him
as an equal indeed ! "
<!-- Leaf 309, Page: 291 -->

\"In the first place, papa," rejoined
FeUcie, gently, but with a shade more of
firmness in her tone, " one does not make
one's equal of a man merely by marrying
him; when la grande Mademoiselle married
Lauzun, it was out of her power to make
him her equal."


\"Maybe," interrupted Monsieur de
Verancour; "but he made her pull off his boots
all the same."


\"That regards her confessor, and concerns
her duties of obedience; but, I repeat it,
marriage binds, but does not equalise: in
the next place, I would not shrink from
any sacrifice that should be needed for the
good of our family—of our house."


The Vicomte sprang to his feet, and
clapping his two hands upon his breast,
roared at her loudly, staring at her with all
<!-- Leaf 310, Page: 292 -->
his might. "You, Felicie, you! You
would marry Monsieur Richard ? "


"It is Monsieur Richard who would not
marry me, papa," she replied with
imperturbable calmness.


\"You would consent to be Madame
Prevost," continued her father, unheeding all
interruptions.


"Never, papa," answered she, in a milder
tone, and with even more calmness than
before; " but I would consent to be
Madame de ChateaubreviUe with a hundred
thousand francs of income, and to live half
the year in Paris, where the title of Count
would be easy to obtain."


\"A pretty thing, indeed, for us," sneered
the Vicomte. " A title given by Monsieur
Bonaparte! Why, you would be ashamed
to wear it."
<!-- Leaf 311, Page: 293 -->

\"No, indeed, papa, I should not.
Authority is authority always; and there is
our own cousin, the Marquis de Vovray, who
has let himself be made a Chamberlain,—
the title means Uttle enough for us,—but
it means still the separation from those
beneath, from the mass; that is the
principal thing needed."


Monsieur de Verancour was sdent for
some moments, and rubbed his forehead
anxiously. " Is it possible, FeUcie," he
asked at last, "that you can be serious?
Is it possible you can mean that you would
marry Monsieur Richard?"


\"Father," she answered, steaddy and
slowly, " I teU you again there is no
sacrifice I wiU not make to our position.
I make it to you, I make it to Vevette."
The latter looked up suddenly with an air
<!-- Leaf 312, Page: 294 -->
almost of terror. "It is my duty. We
are not on earth to think of ourselves, but
of others. One of my first duties is to
think of Vevette. Her turn must come
in a year or two." Vevette felt herself
grow cold and shudder inwardly. "And
how is she to be provided for?"


\"You are, indeed, a perfect heroine,"
said the Vicomte, with conviction, and as
though humbled at the superior virtue of
his child.


"Luckily," resumed she, giving an
upward glance of thanksgiving, " I have
always had my duty held up before my
eyes, and, after all, duty is a thing which
a weU-born woman does easily." Poor
